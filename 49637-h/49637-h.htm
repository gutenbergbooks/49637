<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The late Russian Discoveries between Asia and
America have, for some time, engaged the attention
of the curious; more especially since Dr. Robertson's
admirable History of America has been in the hands of
the public. In that valuable performance the elegant
and ingenious author has communicated to the world,
with an accuracy and judgement which so eminently distinguish
all his writings, the most exact information
at that time to be obtained, concerning those important
discoveries. During my stay at Petersburg, my inquiries
were particularly directed to this interesting subject,
in order to learn if any new light had been thrown
on an article of knowledge of such consequence to the
history of mankind. For this purpose I endeavoured to
collect the respective journals of the several voyages
subsequent to the expedition of Beering and Tschirikoff
in 1741, with which the celebrated Muller concludes
his account of the first Russian navigations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>
<p>During the course of my researches I was informed,
that a treatise in the German language, published at
Hamburg and Leipsic in 1776, contained a full and
exact narrative of the Russian voyages, from 1745 to
1770<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>As the author has not prefixed his name, I should
have paid little attention to an anonymous publication,
if I had not been assured, from very good authority, that
the work in question was compiled from the original
journals. Not resting however upon this intelligence, I
took the liberty of applying to Mr. Muller himself, who,
by order of the Empress, had arranged the same journals,
from which the anonymous author is said to
have drawn his materials. Previous to my application,
Mr. Muller had compared the treatise with the original
papers; and he favoured me with the following
strong testimony to its exactness and authenticity:
"Vous fer&egrave;s bien de traduire pour l'usage de vos compatriotes
le petit livre sur les isles situ&eacute;es entre le Kamtchatka
et l'Amerique. II n'y a point de doute, que
l'auteur n'ait et&eacute; pourvu de bons memoires, et qu'il ne
s'en foit fervi fidelement. J'ai confront&eacute; le livre avec les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
originaux." Supported therefore by this very respectable
authority, I considered this treatise as a performance
of the highest credit, and well worthy of being more
generally known and perused. I have accordingly, in
the first part of the present publication, submitted a translation
of it to the reader's candour; and added occasional
notes to such passages as seemed to require an explanation.
The original is divided into sections without any references.
But as it seemed to be more convenient to divide
it into chapters; and to accompany each chapter
with a summary of the contents, and marginal references;
I have moulded it into that form, without making however
any alteration in the order of the journals.</p>

<p>The additional intelligence which I procured at
Petersburg, is thrown into an appendix: It consists
of some new information, and of three journals<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
never before given to the public. Amongst
these I must particularly mention that of Krenitzin and
Levasheff, together with the chart of their voyage,
which was communicated to Dr. Robertson, by order of
the Empress of Russia; and which that justly admired
historian has, in the politest and most obliging manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
permitted me to make use of in this collection. This
voyage, which redounds greatly to the honour of the
sovereign who planned it, confirms in general the authenticity
of the treatise above-mentioned; and ascertains
the reality of the discoveries made by the private merchants.</p>

<p>As a farther illustration of this subject, I collected the
best charts which could be procured at Petersburg,
and of which a list will be given in the following advertisement.
From all these circumstances, I may venture,
perhaps, to hope that the curious and inquisitive
reader will not only find in the following pages the
most authentic and circumstantial account of the progress
and extent of the Russian discoveries, which has
hitherto appeared in any language; but be enabled hereafter
to compare them with those more lately made by
that great and much to be regretted navigator, Captain
Cooke, when his journal shall be communicated to the
public.</p>

<p>As all the furs which are brought from the New
Discovered Islands are sold to the Chinese, I was naturally
led to make enquiries concerning the commerce
between Russia and China; and finding this branch of
traffic much more important than is commonly imagined,
I thought that a general sketch of its present state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
together with a succinct view of the transactions between
the two nations, would not be unacceptable.</p>

<p>The conquest of Siberia, as it first opened a communication
with China, and paved the way to all the interesting
discoveries related in the present attempt, will
not appear unconnected, I trust, with its principal
design.</p>

<p>The materials of this second part, as also of the preliminary
observations concerning Kamtchatka, and the
commerce to the new-discovered islands, are drawn from
books of established and undoubted reputation. Mr. Muller
and Mr. Pallas, from whose interesting works these
historical and commercial subjects are chiefly compiled,
are too well known in the literary world to require any
other vouchers for their judgement, exactness, and fidelity,
than the bare mentioning of their names. I have
only farther to apprize the reader, that, besides the intelligence
extracted from these publications, he will find
some additional circumstances relative to the Russian commerce
with China, which I collected during my continuance
in Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p>I cannot close this address to the reader without
embracing with peculiar satisfaction the just occasion,
which the ensuing treatises upon the Russian discoveries
and commerce afford me, of joining with every friend
of science in the warmest admiration of that enlarged
and liberal spirit, which so strikingly marks the
character of the present Empress of Russia. Since
her accession to the throne, the investigation and discovery
of useful knowledge has been the constant object of
her generous encouragement. The authentic records of
the Russian History have, by her express orders, been properly
arranged; and permission is readily granted of inspecting
them. The most distant parts of her vast dominions
have, at her expence, been explored and described by persons
of great abilities and extensive learning; by which
means new and important lights have been thrown upon
the geography and natural history of those remote regions.
In a word, this truly great princess has contributed
more, in the compass of only a few years, towards
civilizing and informing the minds of her subjects, than
had been effected by all the sovereigns her predecessors
since the glorious &aelig;ra of Peter the Great.</p>

<h2>Table of Russian Weights, Measures of Length, and Value of Money.</h2>


<h4>WEIGHT.</h4>

<p>A pood weighs 40 Russian pounds = 36 English.</p>


<h4>MEASURES OF LENGTH.</h4>

<p>16 vershocks = an arsheen.</p>

<p>An arsheen = 28 inches.</p>

<p>Three arsheens, or seven feet = a fathom<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,
or sazshen.</p>

<p>500 sazshens = a verst.</p>

<p>A degree of longitude comprises 104-1/2 versts = 69-1/2 English miles. A
mile is therefore 1,515 parts of a verst; two miles may then be estimated
equal to three versts, omitting a small fraction.</p>


<h4>VALUE OF RUSSIAN MONEY.</h4>

<p>A rouble = 100 copecs.</p>

<p>Its value varies according to the exchange from 3s. 8d. to 4s. 2d.
Upon an average, however, the value of a rouble is reckoned at four
shillings.</p>

<p>As no astronomical observations have been taken in
the voyages related in this collection, the longitude
and latitude ascribed to the new-discovered islands in the
journals and upon the charts cannot be absolutely depended
upon. Indeed the reader will perceive, that the
position<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of the Fox Islands upon the general map of
Russia is materially different from that assigned to them
upon the chart of Krenitzin and Levasheff. Without
endeavouring to clear up any difficulties which may
arise from this uncertainty, I thought it would be most
satisfactory to have the best charts engraved: the reader
will then be able to compare them with each other, and
with the several journals. Which representation of the
new-discovered islands deserves the preferance, will probably
be ascertained upon the return of captain Clerke
from his present expedition.</p>

<i>Discovery and Conquest of</i> Kamtchatka&mdash;<i>Present state of

<div class="sidenote">First Discovery of Kamtchatka.</div><p>The
Peninsula of Kamtchatka was not discovered
by the Russians before the latter end of the last
century. The first expedition towards those parts was
made in 1696, by sixteen Cossacs, under the command
of Lucas Sem&aelig;noff Morosko, who was sent against the
Koriacks of the river Opooka by Volodimir Atlafsoff
commander of Anadirsk. Morosko continued his march
until he came within four days journey of the river
Kamtchatka, and having rendered a Kamtchadal village
tributary, he returned to Anadirsk<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>The following year Atlafsoff himself at the head of
a larger body of troops penetrated into the Peninsula,
took possession of the river Kamtchatka by erecting a
cross upon its banks; and built some huts upon the
spot, where Upper Kamtchatkoi Ostrog now stands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">That Peninsula conquered and colonised by the
Russians.</div><p>These expeditions were continued during the following
years: Upper and Lower Kamtchatkoi Ostrogs and Bolcheretsk
were built; the Southern district conquered
and colonised; and in 1711 the whole Peninsula was
finally reduced under the dominion of the Russians.</p>

<p>During some years the possession of Kamtchatka
brought very little advantage to the crown, excepting
the small tribute of furs exacted from the inhabitants.
The Russians indeed occasionally hunted in that Peninsula
foxes, wolves, ermines, sables, and other animals,
whose valuable skins form an extensive article of commerce
among the Eastern nations. But the fur trade
carried on from thence was inconsiderable; until the
Russians discovered the islands situated between Asia and
America, in a series of voyages, the journals of which
will be exhibited in the subsequent translation. Since
these discoveries, the variety of rich furs, which are
procured from those Islands, has greatly encreased the
trade of Kamtchatka, and rendered it a very important
branch of the Russian commerce.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>The Peninsula of Kamtchatka lies between 51 and
62 degrees of North latitude, and 173 and 182 of
longitude from the Isle of Fero. It is bounded on
the East and South by the Sea of Kamtchatka, on the
West by the Seas of Ochotsk and Penshinsk, and on the
North by the country of the Koriacs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Present State of Kamtchatka.</div><p>It is
divided into four districts, Bolcheresk, Tigilskaia
Krepost, Verchnei or Upper Kamtchatkoi Ostrog, and
Nishnei or Lower Kamtchatkoi Ostrog. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Government<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The government is vested in the chancery of Bolcheresk, which depends
upon and is subject to the inspection of the chancery
of Ochotsk. The whole Russian force stationed in
the Peninsula consists of no more than three hundred
men<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Population.</div><p>The
present population of Kamtchatka is very small,
amounting to scarce four thousand souls. Formerly the
inhabitants were more numerous, but in 1768, that
country was greatly depopulated by the ravages of the
small-pox, by which disorder five thousand three hundred
and sixty-eight persons were carried off. There are
now only seven hundred and six males in the whole Peninsula
who are tributary, and an hundred and fourteen
in the Kuril Isles, which are subject to Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Tribute.</div><p>The
fixed annual tribute consists in 279 sables, 464
red foxes, 50 sea-otters with a dam, and 38 cub sea-otters.
All furs exported from Kamtchatka pay a duty
of 10 per cent. to the crown; the tenth of the cargoes
brought from the new discovered islands is also delivered
into the customs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Volcanos.</div><p>Many
traces of Volcanos have been observed in this
Peninsula; and there are some mountains, which are at
present in a burning state. The most considerable of
these Volcanos is situated near the Lower Ostrog. In
1762 a great noise was heard issuing from the inside of
that mountain, and flames of fire were seen to burst from
different parts. These flames were immediately succeeded
by a large stream of melted snow water, which flowed
into the neighbouring valley, and drowned two Kamtchadals,
who were at that time upon an hunting party.
The ashes, and other combustible matter, thrown from
the mountain, spread to the circumference of three hundred
versts. In 1767 there was another discharge, but
less considerable. Every night flames of fire were observed
streaming from the mountain; and the eruption
which attended them, did no small damage to the inhabitants
of the Lower Ostrog. Since that year no flames
have been seen; but the mountain emits a constant
smoke. The same ph&aelig;nomenon is also observed upon
another mountain, called Tabaetshinskian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Productions.</div><p>The
face of the country throughout the Peninsula is
chiefly mountainous. It produces in some parts birch,
poplars, alders, willows, underwood, and berries of different
sorts. Greens and other vegetables are raised with
great facility; such as white cabbage, turneps, radishes,
beetroot, carrots, and some cucumbers. Agriculture is
in a very low state, which is chiefly owing to the nature
of the soil and the severe hoar frosts; for though some
trials have been made with respect to the cultivation of
corn, and oats, barley and rye have been sown; yet
no crop has ever been procured sufficient in quality or
quality to answer the pains and expence of raising it.
Hemp however has of late years been cultivated with great
success<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>Every year a vessel, belonging to the crown, sails from
Ochotsk to Kamtchatka laden with salt, provisions, corn,
and Russian manufactures; and returns in June or July
of the following year with skins and furs.</p>

<h4>CHAP. II.<br />

<i>General idea of the commerce carried on to the New Discovered
Islands.&mdash;Equipment of the vessels.&mdash;Risks of the
trade, profits, &amp;c.</i></h4>


<p>Since the conclusion of Beering's voyage, which
was made at the expence of the crown, the prosecution
of the New Discoveries began by him has been almost
entirely carried on by individuals. These persons
were principally merchants of Irkutsk, Yakutsk, and other
natives of Siberia, who formed themselves into small
trading companies, and fitted out vessels at their joint
expence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Equipment of the vessels.</div><p>Most
of the vessels which are equipped for these expeditions
are two masted: they are commonly built without
iron, and in general so badly constructed, that it is
wonderful how they can weather so stormy a sea. They
are called in Russian Skitiki or sewed vessels, because the
planks are sewed together with thongs of leather. Some
few are built in the river of Kamtchatka; but they are
for the most part constructed at the haven of Ochotsk.
The largest of these vessels are manned with seventy men,
and the smallest with forty. The crew generally consists
of an equal number of Russians and Kamtchadals. The<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
latter occasion a considerable saving, as their pay is
small; they also resist, more easily than the former,
the attacks of the scurvy. But Russian mariners are
more enterprising and more to be depended upon in
time of danger than the others; some therefore are
unavoidably necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expences attending this trade.</div><p>The
expences of building and fitting out the vessels
are very considerable: for there is nothing at Ochotsk
but timber for their construction. Accordingly cordage,
sails, and some provisions, must be brought from Yakutsk
upon horses. The dearness of corn and flour,
which must be transported from the districts lying about
the river Lena, renders it impossible to lay-in any
large quantity for the subsistence of the crew during
a voyage, which commonly lasts three or four years.
For this reason no more is provided, than is necessary
to supply the Russian mariners with quass and other
fermented liquors.</p>

<p>From the excessive scarcity of cattle both at Ochotsk
and<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>Kamtchatka very little provision is laid in at
either of those places: but the crew provide themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
with a large store of the flesh of sea animals, which
are caught and cured upon Beering's Island, where the
vessels for the most part winter.</p>

<p>After all expences are paid, the equipment of each
vessel ordinarily costs from 15,000 to 20,000 Roubles.
And sometimes the expences amount to 30,000. Every
vessel is divided into a certain number of shares, generally
from thirty to fifty; and each share is worth
from 300 to 500 Roubles.</p>

<p>The risk of the trade is very great, as shipwrecks are
common in the sea of Kamtchatka, which is full of rocks
and very tempestuous. Besides, the crews are frequently
surprised and killed by the islanders, and the vessels
destroyed. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Profits.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span>In return the profits arising from these
voyages are very considerable, and compensate the inconveniencies
and dangers attending them. For if a
ship comes back after having made a profitable voyage,
the gain at the most moderate computation amounts
to cent. per cent. and frequently to as much more.
Should the vessel be capable of performing a second
expedition, the expences are of course considerably
lessened, and the shares are at a lower price.</p>

<p>Some notion of the general profits arising from
this trade (when the voyage is successful), may be
deduced from the sale of a rich cargo of furs, brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to Kamtchatka, on the 2d of June, 1772, from the
new-discovered islands, in a vessel belonging to Ivan
Popoff.</p>

<p>The tenth part of the skins being delivered to the
customs, the remainder was distributed in fifty-five
shares. Each share consisted of twenty sea-otters,
sixteen black and brown foxes, ten red foxes, three
sea-otter tails; and such a portion was sold upon the
spot from 800 to 1000 Roubles: so that according to
this price the whole lading was worth about 50,000
Roubles<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<i>Furs and skins procured from</i> Kamtchatka <i>and the New
Discovered Islands.</i></h4>


<div class="sidenote">Furs and Skins brought from Kamtchatka and the New
Discovered Islands.</div><p>The principal furs and skins procured from
the Peninsula of Kamtchatka and the New Discovered
Islands are sea-otters, foxes, sables, ermines, wolves, bears,
&amp;c.&mdash;These furs are transported to Ochotsk by sea, and
from thence carried to<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>Kiachta upon the frontiers of
Siberia; where the greatest part of them are sold to
the Chinese at a very considerable profit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sea-Otters.</div><p>Of all these furs the skins
of the sea-otters are the richest and most valuable. Those animals
resort in great numbers to the Aleutian and Fox Islands: they are
called by the Russians Bobry Morski or sea-beavers, and
sometimes Kamtchadal beavers, on account of the resemblance
of their fur to that of the common beaver.
From these circumstances several authors have been led
into a mistake, and have supposed that this animal is
of the beaver species; whereas it is the true sea-otter<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The female are called Matka or dams; and the cubs
till five months old Medviedki or little bears, because their
coat resembles that of a bear; they lose that coat after
five months, and then are called Koschloki.</p>

<p>The fur of the finest sort is thick and long, of a dark
colour, and a fine glossy hue. They are taken four
ways; struck with darts as they are sleeping upon their
backs in the sea, followed in boats and hunted down
till they are tired, surprised in caverns, and taken in
nets.</p>

<p>Their skins fetch different prices according to their
quality.</p>

<p>As these furs fetch so great a price to the Chinese,
they are seldom brought into Russia for sale: and several,
which have been carried to Moscow as a tribute, were
purchased for 30 Roubles per skin; and sent from
thence to the Chinese frontiers, where they were disposed
of at a very high interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Different species of Foxes.</div><p>There
are several species of Foxes, whose skins are
sent from Kamtchatka into Siberia and Russia. Of these
the principal are the black foxes, the Petsi or Arctic
foxes, the red and stone foxes.</p>

<p>The finest black foxes are caught in different parts
of Siberia, and more commonly in the Northern regions
between the Rivers Lena, Indigirka, and Kovyma: the
black foxes found upon the remotest Eastern islands
discovered by the Russians, or the Lyssie Ostrova, are not
so valuable. They are very black and large; but the
coat for the most part is as coarse as that of a wolf.
The great difference in the fineness of the fur, between
these foxes and those of Siberia, arises probably
from the following circumstances. In those islands
the cold is not so severe as in Siberia; and as
there is no wood, the foxes live in holes and caverns
of the rocks; whereas in the abovementioned
parts of Siberia, there are large tracts of forests in
which they find shelter. Some black foxes however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
are occasionally caught in the remotest Eastern
Islands, not wholly destitute of wood, and these are
of great value. In general the Chinese, who pay the
dearest for black furs, do not give more for the black
foxes of the new-discovered islands than from 20 to
30 Roubles per skin.</p>

<p>The arctic or ice foxes are very common upon some of
the New-Discovered Islands. They are called Petsi by the
Russians, and by the Germans blue foxes.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Pennant's
Synopsis.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Their natural
colour is of a bluish grey or ash colour; but they change
their coat at different ages, and in differerent seasons of
the year. In general they are born brown, are white in
winter, and brown in summer; and in spring and autumn,
as the hair gradually falls off, the coat is marked with
different specks and crosses.</p>

<i>Commencement and progress of the</i> Russian <i>Discoveries
in the sea of</i> Kamtchatka&mdash;<i>General division of the
New Discovered Islands.</i></h4>


<p>A Thirst after riches was the chief motive which
excited the Spaniards to the discovery of America;
and which turned the attention of other maritime nations
to that quarter. The same passion for riches occasioned,
about the middle of the sixteenth century, the discovery
and conquest of Northern Asia, a country, before that time,
as unknown to the Europeans, as Thule to the ancients.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Conquest of
Siberia.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The first foundation of
this conquest was laid by the celebrated Yermac<a name="FNanchor_16_16"
id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, at the head of a band of adventurers,
less civilized, but at the same time, not so inhuman
as the conquerors of America. By the accession of
this vast territory, now known by the name of Siberia, the
Russians have acquired an extent of empire never before
attained by any other nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Commencement of the New Discoveries.</div><p>The
first project<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a
href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> for making discoveries
in that tempestuous sea, which lies between Kamtchatka and America,
was conceived and planned by Peter I. the greatest
sovereign who ever sat upon the Russian throne, until
it was adorned by the present empress. The nature and
completion of this project under his immediate successors
are well known to the public from the relation of
the celebrated Muller. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Their progress.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
No sooner had <a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>Beering and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Tschirikoff, in the prosecution of this plan, opened their
way to islands abounding in valuable furs, than private
merchants immediately engaged with ardour in similar
expeditions; and, within a period of ten years, more important
discoveries were made by these individuals, at
their own private cost, than had been hitherto effected by
all the expensive efforts of the crown.</p>

<p>Soon after the return of Beering's crew from the
island where he was ship-wrecked and died, and which
is called after his name, the inhabitants of Kamtchatka
ventured over to that island, to which the sea-otters and
other sea-animals were accustomed to resort in great
numbers. Mednoi Ostroff, or Copper Island, which
takes that appellation from large masses of native copper
found upon the beach, and which lies full in sight of
Beering's Isle, was an easy and speedy discovery.</p>

<p>These two small uninhabited spots were for some time
the only islands that were known; until a scarcity of land
and sea-animals, whose numbers were greatly diminished
by the Russian hunters, occasioned other expeditions.
Several of the vessels which were sent out upon these
voyages were driven by stormy weather to the South-east;
and discovered by that means the Ale&uuml;tian Isles,
situated about the 195th<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> degree of longitude, and but
moderately peopled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>From the year 1745, when it seems these islands were
first visited, until 1750, when the first tribute of furs
was brought from thence to Ochotsk, the government
appears not to have been fully informed of their discovery.
In the last mentioned year, one Lebedeff was commander
of Kamtchatka. From 1755 to 1760, Captain Tsheredoff
and Lieutenant Kashkareff were his successors. In 1760,
Feodor Ivanovitch Soimonoff, governor of Tobolsk, turned
his attention to the abovementioned islands; and, the
same year, Captain Rtistsheff, at Ochotsk, instructed Lieutenant
Shmaleff, the same who was afterwards commander
in Kamtchatka, to promote and favour all expeditions in
those seas. Until this time, all the discoveries subsequent
to Beering's voyage were made, without the interposition
of the court, by private merchants in small vessels
fitted out at their own expence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Empress promotes all attempts towards New
Discoveries.</div><p>The present Empress (to whom every circumstance
which contributes to aggrandize the Russian empire is an object of
attention) has given new life to these discoveries. The merchants
engaged in them have been animated by recompences.
The importance and true position of the Russian<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
islands have been ascertained by an expensive voyage<a
name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, made by order of the crown; and much
additional information will be derived from the journals and charts
of the officers employed in that expedition, whenever
they shall be published.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we may rest assured, that several modern
geographers have erred in advancing America too much
to the West, and in questioning the extent of Siberia Eastwards,
as laid down by the Russians. It appears, indeed,
evident, that the accounts and even conjectures of the
celebrated Muller, concerning the position of those distant
regions, are more and more confirmed by facts; in the
same manner as the justness of his supposition concerning
the form of the coast of the sea of Ochotsk<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> has
been lately established. With respect to the extent of
Siberia, it appears almost beyond a doubt from the most
recent observations, that its Eastern extremity is situated
beyond<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> 200 degrees of longitude. In regard to the
Western coasts of America, all the navigations to the
New Discovered Islands evidently shew, that, between 50<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and 60 degrees of latitude, that Continent advances no
where nearer to Asia than the<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>coasts touched at by
Beering and Tschirikoff, or about 236 degrees of longitude.</p>

<p>As to the New Discovered Islands, no credit must be
given to a chart published in the Geographical Calendar
of St. Petersburg for 1774; in which they are inaccurately
laid down. Nor is the antient chart of the New
Discoveries, published by the Imperial Academy, and
which seems to have been drawn up from mere reports,
more deserving of attention<a name="FNanchor_24_24"
id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of the New Discovered
Islands.</div><p>The late navigators give a far different description
of the Northern Archipelago. From their accounts we
learn, that Beering's Island is situated due East from Kamtchatkoi
Noss, in the 185th degree of longitude. Near it is
Copper Island; and, at some distance from them, East-south-east,
there are three small islands, named by their
inhabitants, Attak, Semitshi, and Shemiya: these are
properly the Ale&uuml;tian Isles; they stretch from West-north-west
towards East-south-east, in the same direction
as Beering's and Copper Islands, in the longitude of
195, and latitude 54.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>To the North-east of these, at the distance of 600 or
800 versts, lies another group of six or more islands,
known by the name of the Andreanoffskie Ostrova.</p>

<p>South-east, or East-south, of these, at the distance of
about 15 degrees, and North by East of the Ale&uuml;tian, begins
the chain of Lyssie Ostrova, or Fox Islands: this chain
of rocks and isles stretches East-north-east between 56 and
61 degrees of North latitude, from 211 degrees of longitude
most probably to the Continent of America; and in a
line of direction, which crosses with that in which the
Ale&uuml;tian isles lie. The largest and most remarkable of
these islands are Umnak, Aghunalashka, or, as it is commonly
shortened, Unalashka, Kadyak, and Alagshak.</p>

<p>Of these and the Ale&uuml;tian Isles, the distance and position
are tolerably well ascertained by ships reckonings,
and latitudes taken by pilots. But the situation of the
Andreanoffsky Isles<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> is still somewhat doubtful, though
probably their direction is East and West; and some of
them may unite with that part of the Fox Islands which
are most contiguous to the opposite Continent.</p>

<p>The main land of America has not been touched at by
any of the vessels in the late expeditions; though possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the time is not far distant when some of the Russian adventurers
will fall in with that coast<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. More to the
North perhaps, at least as high as 70 degrees latitude,
the Continent of America may stretch out nearer to the
coast of the Tschutski; and form a large promontory,
accompanied with islands, which have no connection
with any of the preceding ones. That such a promontory
really exists, and advances to within a very small
distance from Tschukotskoi Noss, can hardly be doubted;
at least it seems to be confirmed by all the latest accounts
which have been procured from those parts<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. That
prolongation, therefore, of America, which by Delisle is
made to extend Westward, and is laid down just opposite
to Kamtchatka, between 50 and 60 degrees latitude, must
be entirely removed; for many of the voyages related
in this collection lay through that part of the ocean,
where this imaginary Continent was marked down.</p>

<p>It is even more than probable, that the Ale&uuml;tian, and
some of the Fox Islands, now well known, are the very
same which Beering fell-in with upon his return; though,
from the unsteadiness of his course, their true position
could not be exactly laid down in the chart of that expedition<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>As the sea of Kamtchatka is now so much frequented,
these conjectures cannot remain long undecided; and it
is only to be wished, that some expeditions were to be
made North-east, in order to discover the nearest coasts
of America. For there is no reason to expect a successful
voyage by taking any other direction; as all the vessels,
which have steered a more southerly course, have
sailed through an open sea, without meeting with any
signs of land.</p>

<p>A very full and judicious account of all the discoveries
hitherto made in the Eastern ocean may be expected from
the celebrated Mr. Muller<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. Meanwhile, I hope the
following account, extracted from the original papers,
and procured from the best intelligence, will be the more
acceptable to the public; as it may prove an inducement
to the Russians to publish fuller and more circumstantial
relations. Besides, the reader will find here a narrative
more authentic and accurate, than what has been
pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>lished in the abovementioned calendar<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>; and several mistakes
in that memoir are here corrected.</p>

<h4>CHAP. II.<br />

<i>Voyages in 1745.</i>&mdash;<i>First discovery of the</i> Ale&uuml;tian Isles <i>by</i>
Michael Nevodtsikoff.</h4>


<p>A voyage made in the year 1745 by Emilian Bassoff
is scarce worth mentioning; as he only reached
Beering's Island, and two smaller ones, which lie South
of the former, and returned on the 31st of July, 1746.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Nevodtsikoff in 1745.</div><p>The
first voyage which is in any wise remarkable, was
undertaken in the year 1745. The vessel was a Shitik
named Eudokia, fitted out at the expence of Aphanassei
Tsebaefskoi, Jacob Tsiuproff and others; she sailed from
the Kamtchatka river Sept. 19, under the command of
Michael Nevodtsikoff a native of Tobolsk.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Discovers the
Ale&uuml;tian Islands.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Having
discovered three unknown islands, they wintered upon one
of them, in order to kill sea-otters, of which there was
a large quantity. These islands were undoubtedly the
nearest<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a
href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Ale&uuml;tian Islands:
the language of the inhabi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>tants
was not understood by an interpreter, whom they
had brought with them from Kamtchatka. For the
purpose therefore of learning this language, they carried
back with them one of the Islanders; and presented
him to the chancery of Bolcheretsk, with a false account
of their proceedings. This islander was examined as
soon as he had acquired a slight knowledge of the Russian
language; and as it is said, gave the following report.
He was called Temnac, and Att was the name of
the island of which he was a native. At some distance
from thence lies a great island called Sabya, of which
the inhabitants are denominated Rogii: these inhabitants,
as the Russians understood or thought they understood
him, made crosses, had books and fire-arms, and
navigated in baidars or leathern canoes. At no great
distance from the island where they wintered, there were
two well-inhabited islands: the first lying E. S. E. and
S. E. by South, the second East and East by South. The
above-mentioned Islander was baptised under the name
of Paul, and sent to Ochotsk.</p>

<p>As the misconduct of the ship's crew towards the natives
was suspected, partly from the loss of several men,
and partly from the report of those Russians, who were
not concerned in the disorderly conduct of their companions,
a strict examination took place; by which the
following circumstances relating to the voyage were
brought to light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Narrative of the Voyage.</div><p>According
to the account of some of the crew, and
particularly of the commander, after six days sailing they
came in sight of the first island on the 24th of September,
at mid-day. They sailed by, and towards evening
they discovered the second island; where they lay at anchor
until the next morning.</p>

<p>The 25th several inhabitants appeared on the coast,
and the pilot was making towards shore in the small
boat, with an intention of landing; but observing their
numbers increase to about an hundred, he was afraid of
venturing among them, although they beckoned to him.
He contented himself therefore with flinging some
needles amongst them: the islanders in return threw
into the boat some sea-fowl of the cormorant kind. He
endeavoured to hold a conversation with them by means
of the interpreters, but no one could understand their
language. And now the crew endeavoured to row the
vessel out to sea; but the wind being contrary, they
were driven to the other side of the same island, where
they cast anchor.</p>

<p>The 26th, Tsiuproff having landed with some of the
crew in order to look for water, met several inhabitants:
he gave them some tobacco and small Chinese pipes; and
received in return a present of a stick, upon which the
head of a seal was carved. They endeavoured to wrest his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
hunting gun from him; but upon his refusing to part
with it and retiring to the small boat, the islanders ran
after him; and seized the rope by which the boat was
made fast to shore. This violent attack obliged Tsiuproff
to fire; and having wounded one person in the hand,
they all let go their hold; and he rowed off to the ship.
The Savages no sooner saw that their companion was hurt,
than they threw off their cloaths, carried the wounded
person naked into the sea, and washed him. In consequence
of this encounter the ship's crew would not venture
to winter at this place, but rowed back again to the
other island, where they came to an anchor.</p>

<p>The next morning Tsiuproff, and a certain Shaffyrin
landed with a more considerable party: they observed
several traces of inhabitants; but meeting no one they
returned to the ship, and coasted along the island. The
following day the Cossac Shekurdin went on shore, accompanied
by five sailors: two of whom he sent back
with a supply of water; and remained himself with the
others in order to hunt sea-otters. At night they came
to some dwellings inhabited by five families: upon their
approach the natives abandoned their huts with precipitation,
and hid themselves among the rocks. Shekurdin
no sooner returned to the ship, than he was again
sent on shore with a larger company, in order to look out
for a proper place to lay up the vessel during winter: In
their way they observed fifteen islanders upon an height;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and threw them some fragments of dried fish in order to
entice them to approach nearer. But as this overture
did not succeed, Tsiuproff, who was one of the party,
ordered some of the crew to mount the height, and to
seize one of the inhabitants, for the purpose of learning
their language: this order was accordingly executed,
notwithstanding the resistance which the islanders made
with their bone spears; the Russians immediately returned
with their prisoner to the ship. They were soon
afterwards driven to sea by a violent storm, and beat
about from the 2d to the 9th of October, during which
time they lost their anchor and boat; at length they
came back to the same island, where they passed the
winter.</p>

<p>Soon after their landing they found in an adjacent hut
the dead bodies of two of the inhabitants, who had probably
been killed in the last encounter. In their way the
Russians were met by an old woman, who had been taken
prisoner, and set at liberty. She was accompanied with
thirty-four islanders of both sexes, who all came dancing
to the sound of a drum; and brought with them a present
of coloured earth. Pieces of cloth, thimbles, and
needles, were distributed among them in return; and
they parted amicably. Before the end of October, the
same persons, together with the old woman and several
children, returned dancing as before, and brought birds,
fish, and other provision. Having passed the night with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the Russians, they took their leave. Soon after their departure,
Tsiuproff, Shaffyrin, and Nevodsikoff, accompanied
with seven of the crew, went after them, and found them
among the rocks. In this interview the natives behaved
in the most friendly manner, and exchanged a baidar and
some skins for two shirts. They were observed to have
hatchets of sharpened stone, and needles made of bone:
they lived upon the flesh of sea-otters, seals, and sea-lions,
which they killed with clubs and bone lances.</p>

<p>So early as the 24th of October, Tsiuproff had sent
ten persons, under the command of Larion Belayeff, upon
a reconnoitring party. The latter treated the inhabitants
in an hostile manner; upon which they defended themselves
as well as they could with their bone lances. This
resistance gave him a pretext for firing; and accordingly
he shot the whole number, amounting to fifteen men,
in order to get at their wives.</p>

<p>Shekurdin, shocked at these cruel proceedings, retired
unperceived to the ship, and brought an account of
all that had passed. Tsiuproff, instead of punishing these
cruelties as they deserved, was secretly pleased with them;
for he himself was affronted at the islanders for having
refused to give him an iron bolt, which he saw in their
possession. He had, in consequence of their refusal,
committed several acts of hostilities against them; and
had even formed the horrid design of poisoning
them with a mixture of corrosive sublimate. In order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
however to preserve appearances, he dispatched Shekurdin
and Nevodsikoff to reproach Belayeff for his disorderly
conduct; but sent him at the same time, by the above-mentioned
persons, more powder and ball.</p>

<p>The Russians continued upon this island, where they
caught a large quantity of sea otters, until the 14th
of September, 1746; when, no longer thinking themselves
secure, they put to sea with an intention of looking
out for some uninhabited islands. Being however overtaken
by a violent storm, they were driven about until
the 30th of October, when their vessel struck upon a
rocky shore, and was shipwrecked, with the loss of almost
all the tackle, and the greatest part of the furs.
Worn out at length with cold and fatigue, they ventured,
the first of November, to penetrate into the interior
part of the country, which they found rocky and uneven.
Upon their coming to some huts, they were informed,
that they were cast away upon the island of
Karaga, the inhabitants of which were tributary to Russia,
and of the Koraki tribe. The islanders behaved to them
with great kindness, until Belayeff had the imprudence
to make proposals to the wife of the chief. The woman
gave immediate intelligence to her husband; and the
natives were incensed to such a degree, that they threatened
the whole crew with immediate death: but means
were found to pacify them, and they continued to live
with the Russians upon the same good terms as before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>The 30th of May, 1747, a party of Olotorians made a
descent upon the island in three baidars, and attacked
the natives; but, after some loss on both sides, they went
away. They returned soon after with a larger force, and
were again forced to retire. But as they threatened to
come again in a short time, and to destroy all the inhabitants
who paid tribute, the latter advised the Russians to
retire from the island, and assisted them in building two
baidars. With these they put to sea the 27th of June,
and landed the 21st of July at Kamtchatka, with the
rest of their cargo, consisting of 320 sea-otters, of which,
they paid the tenth into the customs. During this expedition
twelve men were lost.</p>

<i>Successive voyages, from</i> 1747 to 1753, <i>to</i> Beering's <i>and</i>
Copper Island, <i>and to the</i> Ale&uuml;tian Isles.&mdash;<i>Some account
of the inhabitants.</i></h4>


<p>In the year 1747<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> two vessels sailed from the Kamtchatka
river, according to a permission granted by the
chancery of Bolckeretsk for hunting sea-otters. One
was fitted out by Andrew Wsevidoff, and carried forty-six
men, besides eight Cossacs: the other belonged to
Feodor Cholodiloff, Andrew Tolstyk, and company; and
had on board a crew, consisting of forty-one Russians and
Kamtchadals, with six Cossacs.</p>

<p>The latter vessel sailed the 20th of October, and was
forced, by stress of weather and other accidents, to winter
at Beering's Island. From thence they departed May the
31st, 1748, and touched at another small island, in order
to provide themselves with water and other necessaries.
They then steered S. E. for a considerable way without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
discovering any new islands; and, being in great want
of provisions, returned into Kamtchatka River, August
14, with a cargo of 250 old sea-otter-skins, above 100
young ones, 148 petsi or arctic fox-skins, which were all
slain upon Beering's Island.</p>

<p>We have no sufficient account of Wsevidoff's voyage.
All that is known amounts only to this, that he returned
the 25th of July, 1749, after having probably touched
upon one of the nearest Ale&uuml;tian Isles which was uninhabited:
his cargo consisted of the skins of 1040 sea-otters,
and 2000 arctic foxes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Emilian Yugoff.</div><p>Emilian
Yugoff, a merchant of Yakutsk, obtained from
the senate of St. Petersburg the permission of fitting out
four vessels for himself and his associates. He procured, at
the same time, the exclusive privilege of hunting sea-otters
upon Beering's and Copper Island during these
expeditions; and for this monopoly he agreed to deliver
to the customs the tenth of the furs.</p>

<p>October 6, 1750, he put to sea from Bolcheresk, in
the sloop John, manned with twenty-five Russians and
Kamtchadals, and two Cossacs: he was soon overtaken
by a storm, and the vessel driven on shore between the
mouths of the rivers Kronotsk and Tschasminsk.</p>

<p>October 1751, he again set sail. He had been commanded
to take on board some officers of the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
navy; and, as he disobeyed this injunction, the chancery
of Irkutsk issued an order to confiscate his ship and cargo
upon his return. The ship returned on the 22d of July,
1754, to New Kamtchatkoi Ostrog, laden with the skins
of 755 old sea-otters, of 35 cub sea-otters, of 447 cubs
of sea-bears, and of 7044 arctic fox-skins: of the
latter 2000 were white, and 1765 black. These furs
were procured upon Beering's and Copper Island. Yugoff
himself died upon the last-mentioned island. The
cargo of the ship was, according to the above-mentioned
order, sealed and properly secured. But as it appeared
that certain persons had deposited money in Yugoff's
hand, for the purpose of equipping a second vessel, the
crown delivered up the confiscated cargo, after reserving
the third part according to the original stipulation.</p>

<p>This kind of charter-company, if it may be so called,
being soon dissolved for misconduct and want of sufficient
stock, other merchants were allowed the privilege of fitting
out vessels, even before the return of Yugoff's ship;
and these persons were more fortunate in making new
discoveries than the above-mentioned monopolist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of the Boris and Glebb.</div><p>Nikiphor
Trapesnikoff, a merchant of Irkutsk, obtained
the permission of sending out a ship, called the
Boris and Glebb, upon the condition of paying, besides
the tribute which might be exacted, the tenth of all the
furs. The Cossac Sila Sheffyrin went on board this<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
vessel for the purpose of collecting the tribute. They sailed
in August, 1749, from the Kamtchatka river; and re-entered
it the 16th of the same month, 1753, with a
large cargo of furs. In the spring of the same year,
they had touched upon an unknown island, probably one
of the Ale&uuml;tians, where several of the inhabitants were
prevailed upon to pay a tribute of sea-otter skins. The
names of the islanders who had been made tributary,
were Igya, Oeknu, Ogogoektack, Shabukiauck, Alak,
Tutun, Ononushan, Rotog&egrave;i, Tschinitu, Vatsch, Ashagat,
Avyjanishaga, Unashayupu, Lak, Yanshugalik, Umgalikan,
Shati, Kyipago, and Oloshkot<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; another Ale&uuml;tian
had contributed three sea-otters. They brought with
them 320 best sea-otter skins, 480 of the second, and
400 of the third sort, 500 female and middle aged, and
220 medwedki or young ones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Andrew Tolstyk to the Ale&uuml;tian
Isles, 1749.</div><p>Andrew Tolstyk, a merchant of Selenginsk, having
obtained permission from the chancery of Bolsheretsk,
refitted the same ship which had made a former voyage;
he sailed from Kamtchatka August the 19th, 1749, and
returned July the 3d, 1752.</p>

<p>According to the commander's account, the ship lay
at anchor from the 6th of September, 1749, to the 20th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of May, 1750, before Beering's Island, where they caught
only 47 sea-otters. From thence they made to those
Ale&uuml;tian Islands, which were<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> first discovered by Nevodsikoff,
and slew there 1662 old and middle-aged sea-otters,
and 119 cubs; besides which, their cargo consisted
of the skins of 720 blue foxes, and of 840 young
sea-bears.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these islands appeared to have never
before paid tribute; and seemed to be a-kin to the
Tschuktski tribe, their women being ornamented with
different figures sewed into the skin in the manner of that
people, and of the Tungusians of Siberia. They differed
however from them, by having two small holes cut
through the bottom of their under-lips, through each of
which they pass a bit of the sea-horse tush, worked into
the form of a tooth, with a small button at one end to
keep it within the mouth when it is placed in the
hole. They had killed, without being provoked, two of
the Kamtchadals who belonged to the ship. Upon the
third Island some inhabitants had payed tribute; their
names were reported to be Anitin, Altakukor, and Aleshkut,
with his son Atschelap. The weapons of the whole
island consisted of no more than twelve spears pointed
with flint, and one dart of bone pointed with the same;
and the Russians observed in the possession of the natives
two figures, carved out of wood, resembling sea-lions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Vorobieff, 1750.</div><p>August
3, 1750, the vessel Simeon and John, fitted
out by the above-mentioned Wsevidoff, agent for the
Russian merchant A. Rybenskoi, and manned with fourteen
Russians (who were partly merchants and partly
hunters) and thirty Kamtchadals, sailed out for the
discovery of new islands, under the command of the
Cossac Vorobieff. They were driven by a violent current
and tempestuous weather to a small desert island, whose
position is not determined; but which was probably one
of those that lie near Beering's Island. The ship being
so shattered by the storm, that it was no longer in a
condition to keep the sea, Vorobieff built another small
vessel with drift-wood, which he called Jeremiah; in
which he arrived at Kamtchatka in Autumn, 1752.</p>

<p>Upon the above-mentioned island were caught 700
old and 120 cub sea-otters, 1900 blue foxes, 5700 black
sea-bears, and 1310 Kotiki, or cub sea-bears.</p>

<p>A voyage made about this time from Anadyrsk deserves
to be mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Novikoff and Bacchoff from
Anadyrsk.</div><p>August 24, 1749, Simeon Novikoff of Yakutsk, and
Ivan Bacchoff of Ustyug, agents for Ivan Shilkin, sailed
from Anadyrsk into the mouth of the Kamtchatka river.
They assigned the insecurity of the roads as their reason
for coming from Anadyrsk to Kamtchatka by sea; on
this account, having determined to risk all the dangers<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of a sea voyage, they built a vessel one hundred and
thirty versts above Anadyr, after having employed two
years and five months in its construction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Narrative of te Voyage.</div><p>The
narrative of their expedition is as follows. In
1748, they sailed down the river Anadyr, and through
two bays, called Kopeikina and Onemenskaya, where they
found many sand banks, but passed round them without
difficulty. From thence they steered into the exterior
gulph, and waited for a favourable wind. Here they saw
several Tschutski, who appeared upon the heights singly
and not in bodies, as if to reconnoitre; which made
them cautious. They had descended the river and its
bays in nine days. In passing the large opening of the
exterior bay, they steered between the beach, that lies to
the left, and a rock near it; where, at about an hundred
and twenty yards from the rock, the depth of water is
from three to four fathoms. From the opening they
steered E. S. E. about fifty versts, in about four fathom
water; then doubled a sandy point, which runs out directly
against the Tshuktshi coast, and thus reached the
open sea.</p>

<p>From the 10th of July to the 30th, they were driven
about by tempestuous winds, at no great distance from
the mouth of the Anadyr; and ran up the small river
Katirka, upon whose banks dwell the Koriacs, a people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>tributary to Russia. The mouth of the river is from
sixty to eighty yards broad, from three to four fathoms
deep, and abounds in fish. From thence they put again
to sea, and after having beat about for some time, they
at length reached Beering's Island. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Shipwreck upon Beering's Island.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> Here they lay at
anchor from the 15th of September to the 30th of October,
when a violent storm blowing right from the sea,
drove the vessel upon the rocks, and dashed her to pieces.
The crew however were saved: and now they looked
out for the remains of Beering's wreck, in order to employ
the materials for the constructing of a boat. They
found indeed some remaining materials, but almost entirely
rotten, and the iron-work corroded with rust.
Having selected however the best cables, and what iron-work
was immediately necessary, and collected
drift-wood during the winter, they built with great difficulty
a small boat, whose keel was only seventeen Russian
ells and an half long, and which they named Capiton.
In this they put to sea, and sailed in search of an unknown
island, which they thought they saw lying
North-east; but finding themselves mistaken, they
tacked about, and stood far Copper Island: from
thence they sailed to Kamtchatka, where they arrived at
the time above-mentioned.</p>

<p>The new constructed vessel was granted in property to
Ivan Shilkin as some compensation for his losses, and
with the privilege of employing it in a future expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to the New Discovered Islands. Accordingly he sailed
therein on the 7th of October, 1757, with a crew of
twenty Russians, and the same number of Kamtchadals:
he was accompanied by Studentzoff a Cossac, who was
sent to collect the tribute for the crown. An account of
this expedition will be given hereafter<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Durneff, in the St. Nicholas,
1754.</div><p>August, 1754, Nikiphor Trapesnikoff fitted out the
Shitik St. Nicholas, which sailed from Kamtchatka under
the command of the Cossac Kodion Durneff. He first
touched at two of the Ale&uuml;tian Isles, and afterwards upon
a third, which had not been yet discovered. He returned
to Kamtchatka in 1747. His cargo consisted of the
skins of 1220 sea-otters, of 410 female, and 665 cubs;
besides which, the crew had obtained in barter from the
islanders the skins of 652 sea-otters, of 30 female ditto,
and 50 cubs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Narrative of the Voyage.</div><p>From
an account delivered in the 3d of May, 1758,
by Durneff and Sheffyrin, who was sent as collector of
the tributes, it appears that they sailed in ten days as far
as Ataku, one of the Ale&uuml;tian Islands; that they remained
there until the year 1757, and lived upon amicable terms
with the natives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description of the Ale&uuml;tian
Isles.</div><p>The second island, which is nearest to Ataku, and
which contains the greatest number of inhabitants,
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
called Agataku; and the third Shemya: they lie from
forty to fifty versts asunder. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Account of inhabitants.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> Upon all the three islands
there are (exclusive of children) but sixty males, whom they
made tributary. The inhabitants live upon roots which
grow wild, and sea animals: they do not employ themselves
in catching fish, although the rivers abound with all kinds
of salmon, and the sea with turbot. Their cloaths are
made of the skins of birds and of sea-otters. The Toigon
or chief of the first island informed them by means of a
boy, who understood the Russian language, that Eastward
there are three large and well peopled islands,
Ibiya, Ricksa, and Olas, whose inhabitants speak a different
language. Sheffyrin and Durneff found upon the
island three round copper plates, with some letters engraved
upon them, and ornamented with foliage, which
the waves had cast upon the shore: they brought them,
together with other trifling curiosities, which they had
procured from the natives, to New Kamtchatkoi Ostrog.</p>

<p>Another ship built of larchwood by the same Trapesnikoff,
which sailed in 1752 under the conduct of Alexei
Drusinin a merchant of Kursk, had been wrecked at Beering's
Island, where the crew constructed another vessel
out of the wreck, which they named Abraham. In this
vessel they bore away for the more distant islands; but
being forced back by contrary winds to the same island,
and meeting with the St. Nicholas upon the point of sailing
for the Ale&uuml;tian Isles, they embarked on that ship, after
having left the new constructed vessel under the care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
four of their own sailors. The crew had slain upon Beering's
Island five sea-otters, 1222 arctic foxes, and 2500
sea-bears: their share of the furs, during their expedition
in the St. Nicholas, amounted to the skins of 500 sea-otters,
and of 300 cubs, exclusive of 200 sea-otter-skins,
which they procured by barter.</p>

Serebranikoff's <i>vessel.&mdash;Some account of the Natives.</i></h4>


<p>Three vessels were fitted out for the islands in
1753, one by Cholodiloff, a second by Serebranikoff
agent for the merchant Rybenskoy, and the third by
Ivan Krassilnikoff a merchant of Kamtchatka.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cholodiloff's Ship sails from Kamchatka
1753.</div><p>Cholodiloff's ship sailed from Kamtchatka, the 19th of
August, manned with thirty-four men; and anchored
the 28th before Beering's Island, where they proposed to
winter, in order to lay-in a flock of provisions: as they
were attempting to land, the boat overset, and nine of
the crew were drowned.</p>

<p>June 30, 1754, they stood out to sea in quest of new
discoveries: the weather however proving stormy and
foggy, and the ship springing a leak, they were all in
danger of perishing: in this situation they unexpectedly
reached one of the Ale&uuml;tian islands, were they lay from
the 15th of September until the 9th of July, 1755. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the autumn of 1754 they were joined by a Kamtchadal,
and a Koriac: these persons, together with four others,
had deserted from Trapesnikoff's crew; and had remained
upon the island in order to catch sea-otters for their
own profit. Four of these deserters were killed by the
islanders for having debauched their wives: but as the
two persons above-mentioned were not guilty of the same
disorderly conduct, the inhabitants supplied them with
women, and lived with them upon the best terms. The
crew slew upon this island above 1600 sea-otters, and
came back safe to Kamtchatka in autumn 1755.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure of Serebranikoff's
Vessel.</div><p>Serebranikoff's vessel sailed in July 1753, manned
also with thirty-four Russians and Kamtchadals: they
discovered several new islands, which were probably
some of the more distant ones; but were not so fortunate
in hunting sea-otters as Cholodiloff's crew. They steered
S. E. and on the 17th of August anchored under an unknown
island; whose inhabitants spoke a language they
did not understand. Here they proposed looking out for
a safe harbour; but were prevented by the coming on of
a sudden storm, which carried away their anchor. The
ship being tost about for several days towards the East,
they discovered not far from the first island four others:
still more to the East three other islands appeared in sight;
but on neither of these were they able to land. <span

and was considerably shattered, when they fortunately
came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
near an island and cast anchor before it; they were however
again forced from this station, the vessel wrecked
upon the coast, and the crew with difficulty reached the
shore.</p>

<p>This island seemed to be right opposite to Katyrskoi
Noss in the peninsula of Kamtchatka, and near it they
saw three others. Towards the end of September Demitri
Trophin, accompanied with nine men, went out
in the boat upon an hunting and reconnoitring party:
they were attacked by a large body of inhabitants, who
hurled darts from a small wooden engine, and wounded
one of the company. The first fire however drove them
back; and although they returned several times to the
attack in numerous bodies, yet they were always repulsed
without difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Account of the Inhabitants.</div><p>These
savages mark and colour their faces like the
Islanders above-mentioned; and also thrust pieces of
bone through holes made in their under-lips.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the Russians were joined in a friendly
manner by ten islanders, who brought the flesh of sea-animals
and of sea-otters; this present was the more
welcome, as they had lived for some time upon nothing
but small shell-fish and roots; and had suffered greatly
from hunger. Several toys were in return

class="hidev">|</span></span> The Russians remained until
June, 1754, upon this island: at that time they departed
in a small vessel, constructed from the remains of
the wreck, and called the St. Peter and Paul: in this they
landed at Katyrskoi Noss; where having collected 140
sea-horse teeth, they got safe to the mouth of the Kamtchatka
river.</p>

<p>During this voyage twelve Kamtchadals deserted;
of whom six were slain, together with a female inhabitant,
upon one of the most distant islands. The
remainder, upon their return to Kamtchatka, were
examined; and from them the following circumstances
came to light. The island, where the ship was wrecked,
is about 70 versts long, and 20 broad. Around it lie
twelve other islands of different sizes, from five to ten
versts distant from each other. Eight of them appear
to be no more than five versts long. All these islands
contain about a thousand souls. The dwellings of the
inhabitants are provided with no other furniture than
benches, and mats of platted grass<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. Their dress consists
of a kind of shirt made of bird-skins, and of an upper
garment of intestines stitched together; they wear wooden
caps, ornamented with a small piece of board projecting
forwards, as it seemed, for a defence against the
arrows. They are all provided with stone knives, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
few of them possess iron ones: their only weapons are
arrows with points of bone or flint, which they shoot
from a wooden instrument. There are no trees upon
the island: it produces however the cow-parsnip<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, which
grows at Kamtchatka. The climate is by no means
severe, for the snow does not lie upon the ground above
a month in the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure of Krassilnikoff's
Vessel.</div><p>Krassilnikoff's vessel sailed in 1754, and anchored on
the 18th of October before Beering's Island; where all
the ships which make to the New Discovered Islands are
accustomed to winter, in order to procure a stock of salted
provisions from the sea-cows and other amphibious animals,
that are found in great abundance. Here they
refitted the vessel, which had been damaged by driving
upon her anchor; and having laid in a sufficient store
of all necessaries, weighed the 1st of August, 1754.
The 10th they were in sight of an island, whose coast
was lined with such a number of inhabitants, that they
durst not venture ashore. Accordingly they stood out
to sea, and being overtaken by a storm, they were reduced
to great distress for want of water; at length they were
driven upon Copper Island, where they landed; and
having taken in wood and water, they again set sail.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Shipwrecked upon Copper
Island.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> They were beat back however
by contrary winds, and dropped both their anchors near the shore; but
the storm increasing at night, both the cables were broken,
and the ship dashed to pieces upon the coast. All
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
crew were fortunately saved; and means were found to
get ashore the ship's tackle, ammunition, guns, and the
remains of the wreck; the provisions, however, were
mostly spoiled. Here they were exposed to a variety of
misfortunes; three of them were drowned on the 15th
of October, as they were going to hunt; others almost
perished with hunger, having no nourishment but small
shell-fish and roots. On the 29th of December great part
of the ship's tackle, and all the wood, which they had
collected from the wreck, was washed away during an
high sea. Notwithstanding their distresses, they continued
their hunting parties, and caught 103 sea-otters,
together with 1390 blue foxes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Crew reach Beering's Island in two
Baidars.</div><p>In spring they put to sea for Beering's Island in two
baidars, carrying with them all the ammunition, fire-arms,
and remaining tackle. Having reached that island,
they found the small vessel Abraham, under the care of
the four sailors who had been left ashore by the crew of
Trapesnikoff's ship: but as that vessel was not large
enough to contain the whole number, together with their
cargo of furs, they staid until Serebranikoff's and Tolstyk's
vessels arrived. These took in eleven of the crew, with
their part of the furs. Twelve remained at Beering's
Island, where they killed great numbers of arctic foxes,
and returned to Kamtchatka in the Abraham, excepting
two, who joined Shilkin's crew.</p>

<i>Voyages from 1756 to 1758.</i></h4>


<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Andrean Tolstyk in 1756 to the
Ale&uuml;tian Isles.</div><p>September 17, 1756, the vessel Andrean and
Natalia, fitted out by Andrean Tolstyk, merchant
of Selenginsk, and manned with thirty-eight Russians
and Kamtchadals, sailed from the mouth of the Kamtchatka
river. The autumnal storms coming on, and a
scarcity of provisions ensuing, they made to Beering's
Island, where they continued until the 14th of June
1757. As no sea-otters came on shore that winter, they
killed nothing but seals, sea-lions, and sea-cows; whose
flesh served them for provision, and their skins for the
coverings of baidars.</p>

<p>June 13, 1757, they weighed anchor, and after
eleven days sailing came to Ataku, one of the Ale&uuml;tian
isles discovered by Nevodsikoff. Here they found the
inhabitants, as well of that, as of the other two islands,
assembled; these islanders had just taken leave of the
crew of Trapesnikoff's vessel, which had sailed for
Kamtchatka. The Russians seized this opportunity of
persuading them to pay tribute; with this view they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
beckoned the Toigon, whose name was Tunulgasen: the
latter recollected one of the crew, a Koriac, who had
formerly been left upon these islands, and who knew
something of their language. A copper kettle, a fur
and cloth coat, a pair of breeches, stockings and boots,
were bestowed upon this chief, who was prevailed upon
by these presents to pay tribute. Upon his departure
for his own island, he left behind him three women and
a boy, in order to be taught the Russian language, which
the latter very soon learned.</p>

<p>The Russians wintered upon this island, and divided
themselves, as usual, into different hunting parties: they
were compelled, by stormy weather, to remain there
until the 17th of June, 1758: before they went away,
the above-mentioned chief returned with his family, and
paid a year's tribute.</p>

<p>This vessel brought to Kamtchatka the most circumstantial
account of the Ale&uuml;tian isles which had been yet
received.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Account of those Islands.</div><p>The
two largest contained at that time about fifty
males, with whom the Russians had lived in great harmony.
They heard of a fourth island, lying at some
distance from the third, called by the natives Iviya, but
which they did not reach on account of the tempestuous
weather.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>The first island is about an hundred versts long and
from five to twenty broad. They esteemed the distance
from the first to the second, which lies East by South, to
be about thirty versts, and about forty from the latter to
the third, which stands South East. The original dress
of the islanders was made of the skins of birds, sea-otters
and seals, which were tanned; but the greatest part had
procured from the Russians dog-skin coats, and under-garments
of sheep-skin, which they were very fond of.
They are represented as naturally talkative, quick of apprehension,
and much attached to the Russians. Their
dwellings are hollowed in the ground, and covered with
wooden roofs resembling the huts in the peninsula of
Kamtchatka. Their principal food is the flesh of sea
animals, which they harpoon with their bone lances;
they also feed upon several species of roots and berries:
namely<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>cloud-berries, crake-berries, bilberries, and services.
The rivulets abound with salmon, and other
fish of the trout kind similar to those of Kamtchatka;
and the sea with turbot, which are caught with bone
hooks.</p>

<p>These islands produce quantities of small osiers and
underwood, but no large trees: the sea however drives
ashore fir and larch, sufficient for the construction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
their huts. There are a great number of arctic foxes
upon the first island, as well as sea-otters; and the shores,
during stormy weather, are covered with wild geese and
ducks.</p>

<p>The Russians, according to the order of the chancery
of Bolcheretsk, endeavoured to persuade the Toigon of
these islands to accompany them to Kamtchatka, but without
success: upon their departure they distributed among
the islanders some linen, and thirteen nets for the purpose
of catching sea-otters, which were very thankfully
received. This vessel brought to Kamtchatka the skins
of 5030 old and young sea-otters, of 1040 old and
young arctic foxes, and of 330 Medwedki or cubs of
sea-otters.</p>

<p>In the year 1757, Ivan Nikiphoroff, a merchant of
Moscow, sent out a vessel: but we have no further account
of this voyage, than that she sailed to the Fox
Islands, at least as far as Umnak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Ivan Shilkin in the Capiton
1757.</div><p>The small vessel Capiton, the same that was built
upon Beering's Island, and which was given to the merchant<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Ivan Shilkin, put to sea September 26, 1757,
carrying on board the Cossac Ignatius Studentsoff, who
has given an account of the voyage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>They had not long sailed, before they were driven back
to the shore of Kamtchatka by stress of weather, and the
vessel stranded; by which accident they lost the rudder
and one of the crew. This misfortune prevented them
from putting to sea again until the following year, with
thirty-nine of the original crew, several persons being
left behind on account of sickness. They made directly
to Beering's Island, where they took up two of Krasilnikoff's
crew<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, who had been shipwrecked. They again
set sail in August of the same year, and touched at the
nearest Ale&uuml;tian Isles, after suffering greatly from storms.
They then continued their course to the remoter islands
lying between East and South East; and having passed
by the first, they anchored before the second. A boat
being immediately sent out towards the shore, the crew
was attacked by a numerous body of islanders in so sudden
a manner, that they had scarcely time to secure themselves
by returning to the vessel. They had no sooner
got aboard, than a violent gale of wind blowing from the
shore broke the cable, and drove them out to sea. <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Shipwrecked upon one of the
Fox Islands.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The
weather became suddenly thick and foggy; and under
these circumstances the vessel was forced upon a small
island at no great distance from the other, and shipwrecked.
The crew got to shore with difficulty, and
were able to save nothing but the fire-arms and ammunition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>They had scarcely got to land, before they were beset
by a number of savages, rowing in baidars from the
Western point of the island. This attack was the more
to be dreaded, because several of the Russians were disabled
by cold and wet; and there remained only fifteen
capable of defending themselves. They advanced however
without hesitation to the islanders; and one Nicholas
Tsiuproff (who had a slight knowledge of their
language) accosted and endeavoured to sooth them, but
without success. For upon their approach the savages
gave a sudden shout, and saluting them at the same time
with a volley of darts, wounded one person in the hand.
Upon this the Russians fired, killed two of the assailants,
and forced the remainder to retire: and although a fresh
body appeared in sight, as if they were coming to the
assistance of their companions, yet no new attack was
made. Soon afterwards the savages left the island, and
rowed across the strait.</p>

<p>From the 6th of September to the 23d of April, they
underwent all the extremities of famine: during that period
their best fare was shell-fish and roots; and they
were even at times reduced to still the cravings of their
appetite with the leather, which the waves washed ashore
from the wreck. Seventeen died of hunger, and the rest
would soon have followed their companions, if they had
not fortunately discovered a dead whale, which the sea
had cast ashore. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The

winter, where they slew 230 sea-otters: and having
built a small vessel out of the remains of the wreck, they
put to sea in the beginning of summer 1760. They
had scarcely reached one of the Ale&uuml;tian islands, where
Serebranikoff's vessel lay at anchor, when they were again
shipwrecked, and lost all the remaining tackle and furs.
Only thirteen of the crew now remained, who returned
on board the above-mentioned vessel to Kamtchatka July
1751.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of the St. Vladimir, commanded by Paikoff,
1758.</div><p>September 1758, the merchant Simeon Krasilnikoff
and Nikiphor Trapesnikoff fitted out two vessels
for the purpose of catching sea-otters. One of these vessels,
called the St. Vladimir, sailed the 28th under the command
of Demetri Paikoff, carrying on board the Cossac Sila
Shaffyrin as collector of the tribute, and a crew of forty-five
men. In twenty-four hours they reached Beering's
Island, where they wintered. July 16, 1759, they
steered towards the South in order to discover land, but
being disappointed, they bore away to the North for the
Ale&uuml;tian isles: being prevented however by contrary
winds from reaching them, they sailed streight towards
the distant islands, which are known at present under
the name of Lyssie Ostrova or the Fox Islands. <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Arrival at the Fox
Island.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> September
1, they reached the first of these, called by the natives
Atchu, and by the Russians Goreloi or the Burnt
Island:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
but as the coasts were very steep and craggy, they made
to Amlach, lying at a small distance, where they determined
to pass the winter. They divided themselves accordingly
into three parties; the first, at the head of
which was Alex&egrave;y Drusinin, went over to a small island
called in the journal Sitkin; the Cossac Shaffyrin led the
second, consisting of ten persons, to the island Atach; and
Simeon Polevoi remained aboard with the rest of the
crew. All these islands were well peopled; the men had
bones thrust through their ears, under lips, and gristle
of their noses; and the faces of the women were marked
with blackish streaks made with a needle and thread in
the skin, in the same manner as a Cossac one of the crew
had observed before upon some of the Tschutski. The
inhabitants had no iron; the points of their darts and
lances were tipped with bone and flint.</p>

<p>They at first imagined, that Amlach was uninhabited;
but in one of their hunting parties they found a boy of
eight years old, whom they brought with them: they
gave him the name of Hermolai, and taught him the
Russian language, that he might serve as an interpreter.
After penetrating further they discovered an hut, wherein
were two women, four men, and as many boys, whom
they treated kindly, and employed in hunting, fishing,
and in digging of roots. This kind behaviour encouraged
others to pay frequent visits, and to exchange fish
and flesh for goat's hair, horses manes, and glass beads.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>They procured also four other islanders with their wives,
who dug roots for them: and thus the winter passed
away without any disturbance.</p>

<p>In the spring the hunting parties returned; during
these excursions one man alone was killed upon the island
Atach, and his fire-arms taken away by the natives.
June 1760, the same parties were sent again to the same
islands. Shaffyrin, who headed one of the parties, was
soon afterwards killed, with eleven men, by the inhabitants
of Atach, but for what reason is not known.&mdash;Drusinin
received the first information of this massacre
from some inhabitants of Sitkin, where he then was;
and immediately set out with the remaining hunters to
join their companions, who were left on board. Although
he succeeded in regaining the vessel, their number
was by this time so considerably reduced that their
situation appeared very dangerous: he was soon however
relieved from his apprehensions by the arrival of the
merchant Betshevin's vessel at the island of Atchu<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.
The two crews entered into partnership: the St. Vladimir
received twenty-two men, and transferred eleven
of her own to the other vessel. The former wintered
at Amlach, and the latter continued at anchor before
Atchu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Pushkareff, 1760.</div><p>This
vessel, fitted out at the expence of Betshevin, a
merchant of Irkutsk, was called Gabriel; and put to sea
from the mouth of the Bolshaia Reka July 31st, 1760.
She was manned with forty Russians and twenty Kamtchadals,
and carried on board Gabriel Pushkareff, of the
garrison of Ochotsk, Andrew Shdanoff, Jacob Sharypoff,
Prokop&egrave;i Lobashkoff, together with Nikiphor Golodoff,
and Aphanassei Oskoloff, Betshevin's agents.</p>

<p>Having sailed through the second strait of the Kuril
Isles, they reached the Ale&uuml;tian Isles on the 24th of August.
They stood out from thence in order to make
new discoveries among those more remote islands, which
lie in one continued chain to the extent of 15 degrees
of longitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reaches Atchu, one of the Fox
Islands.</div><p>September 25 they reached Atchu, or Burnt Island, and
found the above-mentioned ship the St. Vladimir, lying
twenty versts from that island, before Amlach, in danger
of being attacked by the islanders. They immediately
joined crews in order to enable the enfeebled company
of the St. Vladimir to continue hunting; and as it is usual
in such cases, entered into a contract for the division of
the profit. During that winter the two crews killed
partly upon Siguyam, about 800 sea otters of different
sizes, about 100 medwedki or cubs, some river otters,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
above 400 red, greyish, and black foxes, and collected
twelve pood of sea-horse teeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departs from thence.</div><p>In June,
of the following year, the two crews were
distributed equally on board the two vessels: Krassilnikoff's
remained at Amlach, with an intention of returning
to Kamtchatka, and Belshevin's put to sea from Atchu
in quest of other islands. They touched first at Umnak
where they met Nikiphoroff's vessel. Here they took
in wood and water, and repaired their sails: they then
sailed to the most remote island Alaksu<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, or Alachshak,
where, having laid up the ship in a bay, they built huts,
and made preparations for wintering. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Winters upon Alaksu.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> This island was very well inhabited,
and the natives behaved at first in a very friendly manner, for
they trafficked with the Russians, and even delivered up nine of
their children as hostages; but such was the lawless and irregular
behaviour of the crew, that the islanders were soon irritated
and provoked to hostilities.</p>

<p>In January 1762, Golodoff and Pushkareff went with
a party of twenty men along the shore; and, as they were
attempting to violate some girls upon the island Unyumga,
were surprised by a numerous body of the natives:
Golodoff and another Russian were killed, and
three were wounded. Not long afterwards the watch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the crew was suddenly attacked by the islanders; four
men were slain upon the spot, as many wounded, and
the huts reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>May 3, Lobaschkoff and another Russian were killed,
as they were going to bathe in the warm springs, which
lie about five versts from the haven: upon which seven
of the hostages were put to death. The same month the
natives attempted to surprise the Russians in their huts;
but being fortunately discovered in time were repulsed by
means of the fire arms. At length the Russians, finding
themselves in continual danger from these attempts,
weighed anchor, and sailed for Umnak, where they took
up two inhabitants with their wives and children, in
order to shew them other islands. They were prevented
however by tempestuous weather from reaching them;
and were driven out to sea Westward with such violence,
that all their sails were carried away: at length on the
23d of September they struck against land, which they
took for the peninsula of Kamtchatka; and they found
it to be the district of Stobolikoi Ostrog. Six men were
immediately dispatched in the small boat and two baidars
to land: they carried with them several girls (who had
been brought from the new discovered islands) in order
to gather berries. Mean while the crew endeavoured to
ply the ship to the windward. When the boat returned,
those on board were scarcely able, on account of the
storm, to row to the ship, and to catch hold of a rope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
which was flung out to them. Two men remained with
the baidars, and were afterwards carried by some Kamtchadals
to New Kamtchatkoi Ostrog. The ship without
one sail remaining was driven along the coast of Kamtchatka
towards Avatcha, and about seventy versts from
that harbour ran into the bay of Kalatzoff on the 25th
of September. Their cargo consisted of the skins of
900 old and young sea-otters, and of 350 foxes.</p>

<p>Pushkareff and his crew had during this voyage behaved
with such inhumanity towards the islanders, that
they were brought to trial in the year 1764; and the
above-mentioned account is taken from the concurring
evidence of several witnesses. It appears also, that they
brought away from Atchu and Amleg two Ale&uuml;tian men
and three boys, Ivan an Ale&uuml;tian interpreter, and above
twenty women and girls whom they debauched. Ivan,
and one of the boys whom they called Moses, were the
only persons who arrived at Kamtchatka. Upon their
first approach to that coast, fourteen women were sent
ashore to dig roots and to gather berries. Of these, two
ran away, and a third was killed, as they were returning
to the ship by one Gorelin: upon this the others in a fit
of despair leaped into the sea and were drowned. All
the remaing Ale&uuml;tians, excepting the two persons above-mentioned,
were immediately thrown overboard by Pushkareff's
order. The account which follows, although it
is found in the depositions, deserves not to be entirely
credited in all particulars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Account of the Inhabitants of
Alacksu.</div><p>The natives of the above-mentioned islands are very
tall and strongly made. They make their cloaths of
the skins of birds; and thrust bones through their under-lips
by way of ornament. They were said to strike
their noses until they bled, in order to suck the blood;
but we are informed from subsequent accounts, that the
blood thus drawn from themselves was intended for other
purposes<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. They were accused even of murdering
their own children in order to drink their blood; but
this is undoubtedly an invention of the criminals, who
represented the islanders in the most hideous colours, in
order to excuse their own cruelties. Their dwellings
under-ground are similar to those of the Kamtchadals;
and have several openings on the sides, through which
they make their escape when the principal entrance is
beset by an enemy. Their weapons consist of arrows
and lances pointed with bone, which they dart at a considerable
distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Animals.</div><p>The island Alaksu is said to
contain rein-deer, bears, wild boars, wolves, otters, and a species
of dogs with long ears, which are very fierce and wild. And as the
greatest part of these animals are not found upon those
Fox Islands which lie nearer to the west, this circum<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>stance
seems to prove that Alaksu is situated at no great
distance from the Continent of America. As to red,
black, and grey foxes, there is so large a quantity, that
they are seen in herds of ten or twenty at a time. Wood
is driven upon the coast in great abundance. The
island produces no large trees, having only some underwood,
and a great variety of bulbs, roots, and berries.
The coasts are frequented by large flocks of sea-birds,
the same which are observed upon the shore of the
sea of Penshinsk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of the Peter and Paul to the

Paul, fitted out at the expence of the merchant Rybenskoi by his agent
Andrew Serebranikoff, and manned with thirty-three persons,
set sail from the mouth of the Kamtchatka river.
They steered southwards until the 20th of September
without seeing any land, when they stood for the Ale&uuml;tian
Isles, one of which they reached the 27th of September.
They remained there until the 24th of June,
1761; during which time they killed upon this and

The Cossac Minyachin, who was on board as collector
of the tribute, calls in his account the first island by the
Russian name of Krugloi, or Round Island, which he
supposes to be about sixty versts in circumference: the

<i>Voyage of</i> Andrean Tolstyk <i>in the</i> St. Andrean <i>and</i> Natalia&mdash;<i>Discovery
of some New Islands called</i> Andreanoffskye
Ostrova&mdash;<i>Description of six of those Islands.</i></h4>


<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Andrean Tolstyk in the St. Andrean and
Natalia, 1760.</div><p>The most remarkable voyage hitherto made is that
of the St. Andrean and Natalia, of which the following
extract is drawn from the Journals of the two
Cossacs, Peter Wasyutinskoi and Maxim Lasaroff. This
vessel, fitted out by the above-mentioned merchant Andrean
Tolstyk, weighed from the mouth of the Kamtchatka
river September 27, 1760; she stood out to sea
right Eastwards, and on the 29th reached Beering's
Island. There she lay at anchor in a bay, from whence
the crew brought all the tackle and lading ashore. Soon
afterwards they were driven upon the shore by a violent
autumnal storm, without any other damage than the loss
of an anchor. Here they passed the winter; and having
refitted their vessel, put to sea June 24, 1761: they
passed by Copper Island, which lies about an hundred
and fifty versts from the former, and steered S. E. towards
the Ale&uuml;tian Isles, which they did not reach before
the 6th of August. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Reaches
Ayagh, one of the Andreanoffikye Islands.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> They cast anchor in an open bay
near Attak, in order to procure an interpreter from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg
72]</a></span>Toigon Tunulgasen; but the latter being dead, they sent
presents to the Toigon Bakutun. As there were already
three ships lying at anchor before this Island, on the 19th
they again stood out to sea in quest of the more distant
islands, for the purpose of exacting a tribute. They
carried on board a relation of the Toigon Bakutun, who
had a slight knowledge of the Russian language. They
steered N. E. and N. E. by E. and were driven, on the
28th, by a high gale of wind towards an island, before
which they immediately cast anchor. The following
morning the two Cossacs with a party of eight persons
went ashore to reconnoitre the island; they saw no inhabitants.
August 30, the vessel was brought into a safe
bay. The next day some of the crew were sent ashore
to procure wood, that the ship might be refitted; but
there were no large trees to be met with upon the whole
island. Lasaroff, who was one of the party, had been
there before in Serebranikoff's vessel: he called the island
Ayagh or Kayachu; and another, which lay about the
distance of twenty versts, Kanaga. As they were returning
to the ship, they saw two islanders rowing in
small canoes towards Kanaga, one of whom had served
as an interpreter, and was known to Lasaroff. The latter
accordingly made them a present of some fresh provision,
which the others gratefully accepted, and then
continued their course across the strait to Kanaga. Soon
afterwards Lasaroff and eight men rowed over to that
island, and having invited the Toigon, who was a
rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>tion
of the above-mentioned interpreter, to pay them a
visit at Kayachu, they immediately returned to the ship.</p>

<p>Near the place where they lay at anchor, a rivulet
falls into the bay; it flows from a lake that is about
two or three versts in circumference, and which is formed
from a number of small springs. Its course is about
eight versts long; and in summer several species of salmon
and other fish, similar to those which are found at
Kamtchatka, ascend the stream as far as the lake.</p>

<p>Lasaroff was employed in fishing in this rivulet, when
the Toigon of Kanaga, accompanied with a considerable
number of the natives in fifteen baidars, arrived at the
ship: he was hospitably entertained, and received several
presents. The Russians seized this opportunity of persuading
the islanders to acknowledge themselves subject
to the Empress, and to pay a regular tribute; to which
they made no great objection. By means of the interpreter,
the following information was obtained from the
Toigon. The natives chiefly subsist upon dried fish and
other sea animals. They catch <a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>turbot of a very large
size, and take seals by means of harpoons, to which they
fasten bladders. They fish for cod with bone hooks,
and lines made of a long and tough species of sea-weed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
which they dip in fresh water and draw out to the size of
a fine packthread.</p>

<p>As soon as the vessel was laid up in a secure place,
Tolstyk, Vassyutin and Lasaroff, with several others,
went in four baidars to Kanaga. The first remained
upon that island, but the two others rowed in two baidars
to Tsetchina, which is separated from Kanaga by a
strait about seven versts in breadth: the islanders received
them amicably, and promised to pay tribute. The
several parties returned all safe to Kayachu, without
having procured any furs. Soon afterwards Tolstyk dispatched
some hunters in four baidars to Tagalak, Atchu,
and Amlach, which lay to the East of Kayachu: none of
these party met with any opposition from the natives:
they accordingly remained with great tranquillity upon
these several islands until the year 1764. Their success
in hunting was not however very great; for they caught
no more than 1880 full grown sea-otters, 778 middle-aged,
and 372 cubs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description of the Andreanoffskye
Islands.</div><p>The following is Lasaroff's description of the
above-mentioned six islands<a name="FNanchor_45_45"
id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> which lie in a chain somewhat
to the North West of the Fox Islands, and must not be
blended with them. The first certain account was
brought by this vessel, the St. Andrean and Natalia,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
from whence they are called the Andreanoffskie Ostrova
or the Islands of St. Andrean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ayagh.</div><p>Ayagh is about an hundred and
fifty versts in circumference:
it contains several high and rocky mountains,
the intervals of which are bare heath and moor ground:
not one forest tree is to be found upon the whole island.
The vegetables seem for the most part like those which
grow in Kamtchatka. Of berries there are found<a
name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>crow
or crake-berries and the larger sort of bilberries, but in
small quantities. Of the roots of burnet and all kinds of
snake weed, there is such abundance as to afford, in case
of necessity, a plentiful provision for the inhabitants.
The above-mentioned rivulet is the only one upon the
island. The number of inhabitants cannot sufficiently
be ascertained, because the natives pass continually from
island to island in their baidars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kanaga.</div><p>Kanaga stands West from Ayagh,
and is two hundred versts in circumference. It contains an high volcano
where the natives find sulphur in summer. At the foot
of this mountain are hot springs, wherein they occasionally
boil their provision. There is no rivulet upon this
island; and the low grounds are similar to those of
Ayagh. The inhabitants are reckoned about two hundred
souls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Tsetchina.</div><p>Tsetchina lies Eastward about
forty versts from Kanaga, and is about eighty in circumference. It is
full of rocky mountains, of which the Bielaia Sopka, or the White
Peak, is the highest. In the valley there are also some
warm springs, but no rivulet abounding in fish: the
island contains only four families.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tagalak.</div><p>Tagalak is forty versts in
circumference, ten East from Tsetchina: it contains a few rocks, but
neither rivulets with fish, nor any vegetable production fit for
nourishment. The coasts are rocky, and dangerous to approach
in baidars. This island is also inhabited by no more
than four families.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Atchu.</div><p>Atchu lies in the same position
forty versts distant from Tagalak, and is about three hundred in
circumference: near it is an harbour, where ships may ride securely
at anchor. It contains many rocky mountains;
and several small rivulets that fall into the sea, and of
which one running Eastwards abounds in fish. The
roots which have just before been mentioned, and bulbs
of white lilies, are found there in plenty. Its inhabitants
amount to about sixty souls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amlach.</div><p>Amlach is a mountainous island
standing to the East more than seven versts from Atchu, and is also
three hundred in circumference. It contains the same num<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>ber
of inhabitants as Atchu, has a commodious
haven, and produces roots in abundance. Of several
small rivulets there is one only which flows towards the
North, that contains any fish. Besides these a cluster of
other islands were observed stretching farther to the
East, which were not touched upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Account of the Inhabitants.</div><p>The
inhabitants of these six islands are tributary to
Russia. They live in holes dug in the earth, in which
they make no fires even in winter. Their clothes are
made like shirts, of the skins of the<a name="FNanchor_47_47"
id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>guillinot and puffin,
which they catch with springes. Over these in rainy
weather they wear an upper garment, made of the bladders
and other dried intestines of seals and sea-lions oiled
and stitched together. They catch cod and turbot with
bone hooks, and eat them raw. As they never lay in a
store of provision, they suffer greatly from hunger in
stormy weather, when they cannot go out to fish; at
which time they are reduced to live upon small shell-fish
and sea-wrack, which they pick up upon the beach and
eat raw. In May and June they kill sea-otters in the following
manner: When the weather is calm, they row
out to sea in several baidars: having found the animal,
they strike him with harpoons, and follow him so closely,
that he cannot easily escape. They take sea dogs in the
same manner. In the severest weather they make no
addition to their usual cloathing. In order to warm<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
themselves in winter, whenever it freezes very hard,
they burn a heap of dry grass, over which they stand
and catch the heat under their clothes. The clothes of
the women and children are made of sea-otter skins, in
the same form as those belonging to the men. Whenever
they pass the night at a distance from home, they
dig a hole in the earth, and lay themselves down in it,
covered only with their clothes and mats of platted grass.
Regardless of every thing but the present moment, destitute
of religion, and without the least appearance of decency,
they seem but few degrees removed from brutes.</p>

<p>As soon as the several baidars sent out upon hunting
parties were returned, and the vessel got ready for their
departure, the Toigons of these islands (excepting Kanaga)
came in baidars to Tolstyk, accompanied with a
considerable number of the natives; their names were
Tsarkulini, Tshunila, Kayugotsk and Mayatok. They
brought with them a voluntary tribute, making presents
of pieces of dried salmon, and unanimously expressing
their satisfaction upon the good conduct of the Russians.
Tolstyk gave them in return some toys and other trifles,
and desired them to recommend to the inhabitants of the
other islands the like friendly behaviour towards the Russian
merchants who should come amongst them, if they
had a mind to be treated in the same manner.</p>

<p>June 14, 1764, they sailed for Kamtchatka, and anchored
on the 19th before Shemiya, one of the Ale&uuml;tian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Islands. The 21st they were forced from their anchor
by tempestuous winds, and driven upon a rocky shore.
This accident obliged them to send the lading ashore, and
to draw the ship upon land in order to repair the damage,
which was done not without great difficulty. On the
18th of August they stood out to sea and made towards
Atchu, which they reached on the 20th. Having
sprung a leak they again refitted the vessel; and, after
taking on board the crew of a ship which had been lately
cast away, they sailed for Kamtchatka. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>The Vessel wrecked upon the Coast of
Kamtchatka.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> On the 4th of
September they came in sight of that peninsula near
Tzaschminskoi Ostrog; and on the 18th, as they were endeavouring
to run into the mouth of the Kamtchatka
river, they were forced by a storm upon the coast. The
vessel was destroyed, and the greatest part of the cargo lost.</p>

<p>I Shall here barely mention that a vessel was fitted
out in August, 1760, at the expence of Terrenti
Tseba&euml;fskoi: but I shall have occasion to be very circumstantial
in my accounts concerning several others,
which sailed during the following years: more copious
information concerning the Fox Islands having been
procured from these voyages, although for the most
part unfortunate, than from all the preceding ones.</p>

<p>In 1762 four vessels sailed for the Fox Islands: of
these only one returned safe to Kamtchatka.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Drusinin in the Zacharias and
Elizabeth, 1762.</div><p>The first was the Zacharias and Elizabeth, fitted out
by Kulkoff, a merchant of Vologda and Company, under
the command of Drusinin, and manned by thirty-four
Russians, and three Kamtchadals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>September the 6th, they weighed anchor from Ochotsk,
and arrived October the 11th in the haven of St. Peter
and Paul, where they wintered. June the 24th, 1763,
they again put to sea, and having reached, after eleven
days sailing, the nearest Ale&uuml;tian Islands, they anchored
before Atach. They staid here about fourteen days,
and took up seven Russians who had been shipwrecked
on this coast. Among these was Korelin, who returned
to Kamtchatka, and brought back the following account
of the voyage.</p>

<p>July the 17th, they sailed from Atach towards the
more distant islands. In the same month they landed
upon an island, where the crew of the Andrean and
Natalia was engaged in hunting; and, having laid in a
provision of water, continued their voyage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival at Umnak.</div><p>In the beginning of
September they arrived at Umnak, one of the Fox Islands, and cast
anchor about a verst from the shore. They found there Glottoff's
vessel, whose voyage will be mentioned in a succeeding
chapter<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.
Drusinin immediately dispatched his first mate Maesnisk
and Korelin, with thirty-four of the crew, to land. They
passed over to the Eastern extremity of the island, which
was distant about seventy versts from the vessel; and returned
safe on the 12th of September. During this
ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>pedition,
they saw several remains of fox-traps which
had been set by the Russians; and met with several
natives who shewed some tribute-quittances. The
same day letters were brought by the islanders from
Medvedeff and Korovin<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, who were just arrived at
Umnak and Unalashka in two vessels fitted out by the
merchants Protassoff and Trapesnikoff. Answers were
returned by the same messengers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Winters at Unalashka.</div><p>On the 22d,
Drusinin sailed to the Northern point of
Unalashka, which lies about fifteen versts from Umnak:
the crew, having laid up the vessel in a safe harbour,
and brought the lading ashore, made preparation to construct
an hut. Soon after their arrival, two Toigons
of the nearest village brought hostages of their own accord;
their example was immediately followed by several
of the more distant villages. Here they received information
of an hunting party sent from Trapesnikoff's
ship. Upon which Maesnyk also dispatched three companies
upon the same errand, one consisting of eleven
men, among whom was Korelin, under the command of
Peter Tsekaleff; a second of the same number, under
Michael Kudyakoff; and a third of nine men, under
Yephim Kaskitsyn. Of these three parties, Tsekaleff's
was the only one of which we have received any circumstantial
account: for not a single person of the
other two parties, or of the crew remaining on board,
ever returned to Kamtchatka.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>Kaskitsyn remained near the haven, and the two
other companies were dispatched to the Northern point
of the island. Kudyakoff stopped at a place called
Kalaktak, which contained about forty inhabitants; Tsekaleff
went on to Inalok, which lies about thirty versts
from Kalaktak. He found there a dwelling with about
seventy inhabitants, whom he behaved to with kindness:
he built an hut for himself and his companions, and
kept a constant watch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All the Crew, except four Russians, destroyed by
the Natives.</div><p>December the 4th, six of the party being dispatched
to look after the pit-falls, there remained only five Russians:
namely, Peter Tsekaleff, Stephen Korelin, Dmitri
Bragin, Gregory Shaffyrin, and Ivan Kokovin: the
islanders took this opportunity of giving the first proofs
of their hostile intentions, which they had hitherto
concealed. As Tsekaleff and Shaffyrin were upon a
visit to the islanders, the latter suddenly, and without
any provocation, struck Tsekaleff upon the head with
a club, and afterwards stabbed him with knives. They
next fell upon Shaffyrin, who defended himself with an
hatchet, and, though desperately wounded, forced his
way back to his companions. Bragin and Korelin, who
remained in the hut, had immediate recourse to their
fire-arms; but Kokovin, who was at a small distance,
was surrounded by the savages, and thrown down.
They continued stabbing him with knives and darts,
until Korelin came to his assistance; the latter having<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
wounded two islanders, and driven away the others,
brought Kokovin half-dead to the hut.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Adventures of the four Russians
upon Unalaskka.</div><p>Soon afterwards the natives surrounded the hut,
which the Russians had taken the precaution to provide with
shooting-holes. The siege lasted four days without intermission.
The islanders were prevented indeed by the
fire-arms from storming the hut; but whenever the
Russians made their appearance, darts were immediately
shot at them from all sides; so that they could not
venture to go out for water. At length when Shaffyrin
and Kokovin were a little recovered, they all sallied out
upon the islanders with their guns and lances; three
persons were killed upon the spot, and several wounded;
upon which the others fled away and dispersed. During
the siege the savages were seen at a little distance
bearing some arms and caps, and holding them up in
triumph: these things belonged to the six Russians, who
had been sent to the pit-falls, and had fallen a sacrifice
to the resentment of the natives.</p>

<p>The latter no sooner disappeared, than the Russians
dragged the baidar into the sea, and rowed without molestation
out of the bay, which is about ten versts broad.
They next landed near a small habitation: finding it
empty they drew the baidar ashore, and went with their
fire-arms and lances across the mountains towards Kalaktak,
where they had left Kudyakoff's party. As they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
approached that place towards evening, they fired from
the heights; but no signal being returned, they concluded,
as was really the case, that this company had
likewise been massacred by the inhabitants. They themselves
narrowly escaped the same fate; for, immediately
upon the report of the fire-arms, numerous bodies of the
islanders made their appearance, and closely pursued the
Russians: darkness however coming on, the latter found
means to escape over the sandy shore of a bay to a rock,
where they were sheltered, and could defend themselves.
They here made so good a use of their arms, that the
islanders thought proper to retire: the fugitives, as soon
as their pursuers were withdrawn, seized the opportunity
of proceeding towards the haven, where their
vessel lay at anchor: they ran without interruption during
the whole night, and at break of day, when they were about
three versts from the haven, they espied a locker of the
vessel lying on the shore. Struck with astonishment at
this alarming discovery, they retreated with precipitation
to the mountains, from whence they descried several
islanders rowing in canoes, but no appearance of their
own vessel. During that day they kept themselves closely
concealed, and durst not venture again towards the haven
before the evening. Upon their arrival they found the
vessel broken to pieces, and the dead bodies of their companions
lying mangled along the beach. Having collected
all the provision which had been untouched by
the savages, they returned to the mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The following day they scooped out a cavity at the
foot of a mountain situated about three versts from the
haven, and covered it with a piece of a sail. In the
evening they returned to the haven, and found there an
image of a saint and a prayer book; all the tackle and
lading were taken away, excepting the sacks for provision.</p>

<p>These sacks were made of leather: the natives had
ript them up probably to see if they contained any iron,
and had left them, together with the provision, behind
as useless. The Russians collected all that remained, and
dragged as much as they were able to carry into the
mountains to their retreat, where they lived in a very
wretched state from the 9th of December to the 2d of
February, 1764.</p>

<p>Mean while they employed themselves in making a
little baidar, which they covered with the leather of the
sacks. Having drawn it at night from the mountains to
the sea, they rowed without waiting for break of day
along the Northern coast of Unalaschka, in order to reach
Trapesnikoff's vessel, which, as they had reason to think,
lay at anchor somewhere upon the coast. They rowed
at some distance from the shore, and by that means passed
three habitations unperceived. The following day
they observed at some distance five islanders in a baidar,
who upon seeing them made to Makushinsk, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
which place the fugitives were obliged to pass. Darkness
coming on, the Russians landed on a rock, and passed the
night ashore. Early in the morning they discovered the
islanders advancing towards them from the bay of Makushinsk.
Upon this they placed themselves in an advantageous
post, and prepared for defence.</p>

<p>The savages rowed close to the beach: part landing,
and part remaining in their baidars, they commenced
the assault by a volley of darts; and notwithstanding the
Russians did great execution with their fire arms, the
skirmish continued the whole day. Towards evening the
enemy retired, and the fugitives betook themselves with
their canoe to an adjoining cavern. The attack was again
renewed during the night; but the Russians were so advantageously
posted, that they repulsed the assailants
without much difficulty. In this encounter Bragen
was slightly wounded. They remained in this place
three days; but the sea rising at a spring-tide into the
rock, forced them to sally out towards a neighbouring
cavern, which they reached without loss, notwithstanding
the opposition of the islanders.</p>

<p>They were imprisoned in this cave five weeks, and kept
watch by turns. During that time they seldom ventured
twenty yards from the entrance; and were obliged
to quench their thirst with snow-water, and with the
moisture dripping from the rock. They suffered also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
greatly from hunger, having no sustenance but small
shell-fish, which they occasionally found means to collect,
upon the beach. Compelled at length by extreme
want, they one night ventured to draw their baidar into
the sea, and were fortunate enough to get off unperceived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their Escape from Unalaschka to Trapesnikoff's
vessel.</div><p>They continued rowing at night, but in the day they
hid themselves on the shore; by this means they escaped
unobserved from the bay of Makushinsk, and reached
Trapesnikoff's vessel the 30th of March, 1764. What
happened to them afterwards in company with the
crew of this vessel will be mentioned in the succeeding
chapter, Shaffyrin alone of all the four died of
sickness during the voyage; but Korelin, Kohovin, and
Bragin<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a
href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> returned safe to
Kamtchatka. The names of these brave men deserve our admiration, for
the courage and perseverance with which they supported and overcame
such imminent dangers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Korovin, 1762.</div><p>The second
vessel which sailed from Kamtchatka in
the year 1762, was the Trinity, fitted out by the
trading company of Nikiphor Trapesnikoff, merchant of
Irkutsk, under the command of Ivan Korovin, and
manned with thirty-eight Russians and six Kamtchadals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departs from Kamtchatka.</div><p>September 15,
they sailed down the Kamtchatka river,
and stood out to sea the 29th, when they were driven
at large for ten days by contrary winds. At last upon
the 8th of October they came in sight of Beering's and
Copper Island, where they cast anchor before the South
side of the former. Here they were resolved to winter
on account of the late season of the year. Accordingly
they laid up the vessel in a secure harbour, and
brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
all the lading ashore. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Winters upon Beering's Island.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> They staid here until the first of
August, 1763: during that time they kilted about 500
arctic foxes and 20 sea-otters; the latter animals resorted
less frequently to this island, in consequence of
the disturbance given them by the Russian hunters.</p>

<p>Korovin, having collected a sufficient store of provision,
several skins of sea-cows for the coverings of baidars,
and some iron which remained from the wreck of
Beering's ship, prepared for his departure. Upon his
arrival at Beering's Island the preceding autumn, he
found there a vessel fitted out by Jacob Protassoff, merchant
of Tiumen, under the command of Dennis Medvedeff<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.
Korovin had entered into a formal contract
with Medvedeff for the division of the furs. Here he
took on board ten of Medvedeff's crew, and gave him
seven in return.</p>

<p>August 1, Korovin put to sea from Beering's Island with
thirty-seven men, and Medvedeff with forty-nine.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Reaches Unalashka.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> They
sailed without coming in sight of the Ale&uuml;tian Isles: on
the 15th, Korovin made Unalashka, where Glottoff lay
at anchor, and Medvedeff reached Umnak. Korovin
received the news of the latter's safe arrival, first by
some islanders, and afterwards by letters; both vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
lay at no greater distance from each other than about
an hundred and fifty versts, taking a streight line from
point to point across the firth.</p>

<p>Korovin cast anchor in a convenient bay at the distance
of sixty yards from the shore. On the 16th he landed
with fourteen men, and having found nothing but an
empty shed, he returned to the vessel. After having
taken a reinforcement, he again went ashore in order to
look for some inhabitants. About seven versts from
the haven, he came to two habitations, and saw three
hundred persons assembled together. Among them
were three Toigons, who recollected and accosted in a
friendly manner one Barnasheff, a native of Tobolsk,
who had been there before with Glottoff; they shewed
some tribute-quittances, which they had lately received
from the Cossac Sabin Ponomareff. Two of these Toigons
gave each a boy of twelve years of age as an
hostage, whom they passed for their children; and the
third delivered his son of about fifteen years of age,
the same who had been Glottoff's hostage, and whom
Korovin called Alex&egrave;y. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Lays up the Ship.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> With these hostages he returned
to the ship, which he laid up in the mouth of a river,
after having brought all the provision and lading ashore.
Soon afterwards the three Toigons came to see the
hostages; and informed Korovin, that Medvedeff's vessel
rode securely at anchor before Umnak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>September 15, when every thing was prepared for
wintering, Korovin and Barnasheff set out in two baidars,
each with nine men and one of the hostages, who had
a slight knowledge of the Russian language. They
went along the Northern coast of the island, towards
its Western extremity, in order to hunt, and to enquire
after a certain interpreter called Kashmak, who had been
employed by Glottoff on a former occasion. Having
rowed about twenty versts, they passed by a village,
and landed at another which lay about five versts further.
But as the number of inhabitants seemed to
amount to two hundred, they durst not venture to the
dwellings, but stayed by the baidar. Upon this the
Toigon of the place came to them, with his wife and
son: he shewed a tribute-quittance, and delivered his
son, a boy of thirteen years of age and whom Korovin
called Stepanka, as an hostage, for which he received a
present of corals.</p>

<p>They rowed now further to a third village, about
fifteen versts from the former, where they found the
interpreter Kashmak; the latter accompanied them to
the two Toigons, who gave them a friendly reception,
and shewed their tribute-quittances. A few natives only
made their appearance; the others, as the Toigons pretended,
were gone out to fish. The next morning each
Toigon gave a boy as an hostage; one of the boys Korovin
called Gregory, and the other Alex&egrave;y. The Rus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>sians
were detained there two days by a violent storm;
during which time a letter from Medvedeff was brought
by an Ale&uuml;tian, and an answer was returned by the same
person. The storm at length somewhat abating, they
rowed back to the next village, where they continued
two nights without any apprehensions from the savages.
At length Korovin returned in safety with the hostages
to the crew.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Builds an Hut, and makes Preparations
for Wintering.</div><p>In the beginning of October they built a
winter-hut, partly of wood and partly of seal-skins, and made all
the necessary preparations for hunting. On the 14th,
two companies, each consisting of eleven men, were sent
out upon an hunting party to the Eastern point of the
island; they returned in four days with hostages.
About sixty versts from the haven, they had met a
party of twenty-five Russians, commanded by Drusinin.
About the same time some Toigons brought a present of
sturgeon and whale's blubber, and received in return
some beads and provision.</p>

<p>Korovin and his company now thought themselves
secure; for which reason twenty-three men, under the
command of the above-mentioned Barnasheff, were dispatched
in two baidars upon an hunting party towards
the Western point of the island. Eight muskets were
distributed to each boat, a pistol and a lance to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
man, and also a sufficient store of ammunition and provision.
The following day two accounts were sent from
Barnasheff; and letters were also received from the crew
of Protassoff's vessel. From the 2d of November to the
8th of December, the Russians, who remained with Korovin,
killed forty-eight dark-coloured foxes, together
with an hundred and seventeen of the common sort:
during this expedition one man was lost. Some of the
natives came occasionally in baidars, and exchanged sea-otters
and fox skins for corals. On the 8th of December
letters were again brought from Barnasheff and also
from the crew of Protassoff's ship. Answers were returned
by the same messengers.</p>

<p>After the departure of these messengers, the mother
of Alex&egrave;y came with a message from the Toigon her husband
importing, that a large number of islanders were
making towards the ship. Upon this Korovin ordered
the men to arms, and soon after seventy natives approached
and held up some sea-otter skins. The Russians cried
out that no more than ten at a time should come over the
brook towards their hut: upon which the islanders left
their skins with Korovin, and returned without attempting
any hostilities. Their apprehensions were now somewhat
quieted, but they were again raised by the arrival
of three Kamtchadals belonging to Kulkoff's ship, who
flew for protection to Korovin: they brought the account
that the crew had been killed by the savages, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the vessel destroyed. It was now certain that the seventy
islanders above-mentioned had come with hostile intentions.
This information spread such a sudden panic
among the Russians, that it was even proposed to burn
the vessel, and to endeavour to find their companions,
who were gone upon hunting parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Russians attacked by the
Natives.</div><p>That day however passed without any attack: but
towards the evening of the 10th of December, the savages assembled
in large bodies, and invested the hut on all
sides. Four days and nights they never ceased annoying
the Russians with their darts; two of the latter were
killed, and the survivors were nearly exhausted by continual
fatigue. Upon the fifth day the islanders took post
in a neighbouring cavern, where they continued watching
the Russians so closely during a whole month, that
none of the latter durst venture fifty paces from
their dwelling. Korovin, finding himself thus annoyed
by the natives, ordered the hut to be destroyed: he
then retired to his vessel, which was brought for greater
security out of the mouth of the rivulet to the distance of
an hundred yards from the beach. There they lay at
anchor from the 5th of March to the 26th of April,
during which time they suffered greatly from want of
provision, and still more from the scurvy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>During this period they were attacked by a large body
of the natives, who advanced in forty baidars with the
hopes of surprising the vessel. Korovin had been warned
of their approach by two of the inhabitants, one of whom
was a relation of the interpreter Kashmak: accordingly
he was prepared for their reception. As soon as
the savages came near the vessel, they brandished
their darts and got ready for the attack. Korovin however
had no sooner fired and killed one person, than they
were struck with a panic and rowed away. They were so
incensed at this failure of success, that they immediately
put to death the two good-natured natives, who had betrayed
their design to the Russians. Soon afterwards the
father of Alex&egrave;y came and demanded his son, who was
restored to him: and on the 30th of March Korovin and
his three companions arrived as it is mentioned in the
preceding chapter. By this reinforcement the number
of the crew amounted to eighteen persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Korovin puts to Sea. The Vessel stranded
upon Umnak.</div><p>April 26 Korovin put to sea from Unalashka with the
crew and eleven hostages. The vessel was driven until
the 28th by contrary winds, and then stranded in a bay
of the island Umnak. The ammunition and sails, together
with the skins for the construction of baidars,
were brought ashore with great difficulty. During the
disembarkation one sick man was drowned, another died
as soon as he came to land, and eight hostages ran
away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
amidst the general confusion. There still remained the
faithful interpreter Kashmak and three hostages. The
whole number of the Russians amounted to only sixteen
persons; and of these three were sick of the scurvy.
Under these circumstances they secured themselves between
their baidar and some empty barrels, which they
covered with seal-skins, while the sails were spread over
them in form of a tent. Two Russians kept watch;
and there being no appearance of any islanders, the
others retired to sleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Russians in Danger of being destroyed
by the Natives.</div><p>Before break of day, about an hundred savages
advancing secretly from the sea-side, threw their darts at
the distance of twenty yards with such force, that many
of them pierced through the baidar and the skins;
others fell from above through the sails. By this discharge,
the two persons who kept watch, together with the three hostages,
were killed upon the spot; and all the Russians were wounded. The
latter indeed were so effectually surprised, as to be prevented
from having recourse to their fire-arms. In this distress Korovin
sallied out, in company with four Russians, and attacked the enemy
with lances: two of the savages were killed, and the others driven
to flight. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The
latter repulsed.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Korovin and his
party were so severely wounded, that they had scarcely strength
sufficient to return to their tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>During the night the storm increased to such a degree,
that the vessel was entirely dashed to pieces. The
greatest part of the wreck, which was cast on shore
by the sea, was carried away by the islanders. They
also broke to pieces the barrels of fat, emptied the sacks
of provision, and destroyed most of the furs: having
thus satisfied their resentment, they went away; and
did not again make their appearance until the 30th of
April. Upon their retiring, the Russians collected the
wretched remains which had been left untouched by
the savages, or which the waves had cast on shore since
their departure.</p>

<p>April 30, a body of an hundred and fifty natives
advanced from the Eastern point of the island towards
the tent; and, at the distance of an hundred yards,
shot at the Russians with fire arms, but luckily without
execution. They also set on fire the high grass, and
the wind blew the flames towards the tent; but the
Russians firing forced the enemy to flight, and gained
time to extinguish the flames.</p>

<p>This was the last attack which was made upon Korovin;
although sickness and misery detained him and his companions
upon this spot until the 21st of July. They then
put to sea in a baidar eight yards long, which they
had constructed in order to make to Protassoff's vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
with whose fate they were as yet unacquainted. Their
number was now reduced to twelve persons, among
whom were six Kamtchadals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Russians discover the dead Bodies of their
Countrymen who had been murdered by the Natives.</div><p>After having
rowed ten days they landed upon the
beach of the same island Umnak; there they observed
the remains of a vessel which had been burnt, and saw
some clothes, sails, and ropes, torn to pieces. At a small
distance was an empty Russian dwelling, and near it a
bath-room, in which they found, to their inexpressible
terror, twenty dead bodies in their clothes. Each of
them had a thong of leather, or his own girdle, fastened
about the neck, with which he had been dragged along.
Korovin and his companions recollected them to have
been some of those who had sailed in Protassoff's vessel;
and could distinguish among the rest the commander
Medvedeff. They discovered no further traces of the
remaining crew; and as none ever appeared, we have
no account of the circumstances with which this catastrophe
was attended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relieved from their Distresses by the Arrival
of Glottoff.</div><p>After having buried his dead countrymen, Korovin
and his companions began to build an hut: they were
prevented however from finishing it, by the unexpected
arrival of Stephen Glottoff<a name="FNanchor_52_52"
id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>, who came to them with
a small party by land. Korovin and his companions
accordingly joined Glottoff, and rowed the next day to
his vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon afterwards Korovin was sent with a party of
twenty men to coast the island of Umnak, in order to
discover if any part of Medvedeff's crew had made their
escape from the general massacre: but his enquiries
were without success. In the course of this expedition,
as he lay at anchor, in September, before a small island
situated between Umnak and Unalashka, some savages
rowed towards the Russians in two large baidars; and
having shot at them with fire-arms, though without
effect, instantly retired. The same evening Korovin
entered a bay of the island Umnak, with an intention
of passing the night on shore: but as he came near
the coast, a large number of savages in an hundred baidars
surrounded and saluted him with a volley of darts.
Korovin fired and soon dispersed them; and immediately
made to a large baidar, which he saw at some distance,
in hopes of finding some Russians. He was
however mistaken; the islanders who were aboard landed
at his approach, and, after shooting at him from their
fire-arms, retired to the mountains.</p>

<p>Korovin found there an empty baidar, which he knew
to be the same in which Barnasheff had sailed, when he
was sent upon an hunting party. Within were nothing
but two hatchets and some iron points for darts. Three
women were seized at the same time; and two natives,
who refused to surrender themselves, were put to death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
They then made to the dwelling, from which all the
inhabitants had run away, and found therein pieces of
Russian leather, blades of small knives, shirts, and other
things, which had belonged to the Russians. All the
information which they could procure from the women
whom they had taken prisoners, was, that the crew had
been killed, and this booty taken away by the inhabitants,
who had retired to the island Unalashka. Korovin
gave these women their liberty, and, being apprehensive
of fresh attacks, returned to the haven.</p>

<p>Towards winter Korovin, with a party of twenty-two
men, was sent upon an hunting expedition to the Western
point of Unalashka: he was accompanied by an
Ale&uuml;tian interpreter, called Ivan Glottoff. Being informed
by some islanders, that a Russian ship, under
the command of Ivan Solovioff<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, was then lying before
Unalashka, he immediately rowed towards the haven
where she was at anchor. On the way he had a sharp
encounter with the natives, who endeavoured to prevent
him from landing: of these, ten were killed
upon the spot; and the remainder fled away, leaving
behind them some women and children.</p>

<p>Korovin staid three days aboard Solovioff's vessel,
and then returned to the place where he had been so
lately attacked. The inhabitants however, for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
time, made no opposition to his landing; on the contrary,
they received him with kindness, and permitted
him to hunt: they even delivered hostages; and entered
into a friendly traffic, exchanging furs for beads. They
were also prevailed upon to restore several muskets
and other things, taken from the Russians who had
been massacred.</p>

<p>A short time before his departure, the inhabitants
again shewed their hostile intentions; for three of them
came up to the Russian centinel, and suddenly fell upon
him with their knives. The centinel however disengaging
himself, and retreating into the hut, they ran
away. The Toigons of the village protested ignorance
of this treachery; and the offenders were soon afterwards
discovered and punished. Korovin, as he was
returning to Glottoff, was forced to engage with the
islanders upon Unalashka, and also upon Umnak, where
they endeavoured to prevent him from landing. Before
the end of the year a storm drove the baidar upon
the beach of the latter island; and the tempestuous
weather setting in, they were detained there until the
6th of April, 1765. During this time they were reduced,
from a scarcity of provision, to live chiefly upon
sea-wrack and small shell fish. On the 22d they returned
to Glottoff; and as they had been unsuccessful
in hunting, their cargo of furs was very inconsiderable.
Three days after his arrival, Korovin quitted Glottoff,
and went over with five other Russians to Solovieff, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
whom he returned the following year to Kamtchatka.
The six Kamtchadals of Korovin's party joined Glottoff.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Korovin's Description of Umnak and
Unalashka.</div><p>According to Korovin's account, the islands Umnak
and Unalashka are situated not much more Northwards
than the mouth of the Kamtchatka river; and, according
to the ship's reckoning, about the distance of 1700
versts Eastwards from the same place. The circumference
of Umnak is about two hundred and fifty versts;
Unalashka is much larger. Both these islands are wholly
destitute of trees; drift-wood is brought ashore in large
quantities. There were five lakes upon the Northern
coast of Unalashka, and but one upon Umnak, of which
none were more than ten versts in circumference. These
lakes give rise to several small rivulets, which flow only
a few versts before they empty themselves into the sea:
the fish enter the rivulets in the middle of April,
they ascend the lakes in July, and continue there until
August. Sea-otters and other sea-animals resort but
seldom to these islands; but there is great abundance of
red and black foxes. North Eastwards from Unalashka
two islands appeared in sight, at the distance of five or
ten versts; but Korovin did not touch at them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Account of the Inhabitants.</div><p>The
inhabitants of these islands row in their small
baidars from one island to the other. They are so
numerous, and their manner of life so unsettled, that
their number cannot exactly be determined. Their<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
dwelling caves are made in the following manner. They
first dig an hole in the earth proportioned to the size of
their intended habitation, of twenty, thirty, or forty
yards in length, and from six to ten broad. They
then set up poles of larch, firs, and ash driven on the
coast by the sea. Across the top of these poles they
lay planks, which they cover with grass and earth.
They enter through holes in the top by means of ladders.
Fifty, an hundred, and even an hundred and fifty
persons dwell together in such a cave. They light little
or no fires within, for which reason these dwellings are
much cleaner than those of the Kamtchadals. When
they want to warm themselves in the winter, they make
a fire of dry herbs, of which they have collected a large
store in summer, and stand over it until they are sufficiently
warmed. A few of these islanders wear fur-stockings
in winter; but the greatest part go bare-footed,
and all are without breeches. The skins of cormorants,
puffins, and sea-divers, serve for the mens clothing; and
the women wear the skins of sea-bears, seals, and sea-otters.
They sleep upon thick mats, which they twist out of a
soft kind of grass that grows upon the shore, and have
no other covering but their usual clothes. Many of the
men have five or six wives; and he that is the best
hunter or fisher has the greatest number. The women
make their needles of the bones of birds wings, and use
sinews for thread.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>Their weapons are bows and arrows, lances and darts,
which they throw like the Greenlanders to the distance of
sixty yards by means of a little hand-board. Both the darts
and arrows are feathered: the former are about an ell and
an half long; the shaft, which is well made considering
their want of instruments, is often composed of two pieces
that join into each other: the point is of flint, sharpened
by beating it between two stones. These darts as well as
the lances were formerly tipped with bone, but at present
the points are commonly made of the iron which they
procure from the Russians, and out of which they
ingeniously form little hatchets and two-edged knives.
They shape the iron by rubbing it between two stones,
and whetting it frequently with sea-water. With these
instruments and stone hatchets they build their baidars.
They have a strange custom of cutting holes in the
under-lip and through the gristle of the nose. They
place in the former two little bones, wrought in the
form of teeth, which project some inches from the
face. In the nose a piece of bone is placed crossways.
The deceased are buried with their boat, weapons, and
clothes<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p>Here follows one of the most memorable voyages
yet made, which extended farther, and terminated
more fortunately, than the last mentioned expeditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Glottoff in the Andrean and Natalia,
1762.</div><p>Terenty Tsebaeffskoi and company, merchants of
Lalsk, fitted out the Andrean and Natalia under the command
of Stephen Glottoff, an experienced and skilful
seaman of Yarensk. This vessel sailed from the bay of
the river Kamtchatka the 1st of October, 1762, manned
with thirty-eight Russians and eight Kamtchadals. In
eight days they reached Mednoi Ostroff, or Copper Island,
where having sought out a convenient harbour, they
unloaded and laid up the vessel for the winter. <span

they killed afterwards a quantity of ice-foxes, and a considerable
number of sea-otters.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the crown and their own use in case
of need, they resolved to take on board all the remaining
tackle and iron work of Beering's ship, which had been
left behind on Commander's Island, and was buried in
the beach. For this purpose they dispatched, on the 27th
of May, Jacob Malevinskoy (who died soon after) with
thirteen men in a baidar to that island, which was seventy
versts distant. They brought back with them twenty-two
pood of iron, ten of old cordage fit for caulker's use,
some lead and copper, and several thousand beads.</p>

<p>Copper Island has its name from the native copper
found on the coast, particularly at the Western point on
its South side. Of this native copper Malevinskoy brought
with him two large pieces weighing together twelve
pounds, which were picked up between a rock and the
sea on a strand of about twelve yards in breadth. Amongst
other floating bodies which the sea drives upon the shores
of this Island, the true right camphor wood, and another
sort of wood very white, soft, and sweet-scented, are
occasionally found.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sails to the Fox Islands.</div><p>Every
preparation for continuing the voyage being
made, they sailed from Copper Island the 26th of July,
1763, and steered for the Islands Umnak and
Aguna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>lashka,
where Glottoff had formerly observed great numbers
of black foxes. On account of storms and contrary
winds, they were thirty days before they fetched Umnak.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Arrive at
Kadyak.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Here
they arrived the 24th of August, and without dropping
anchor or losing any time, they resolved to sail further
for the discovery of new islands: they passed eight
contiguous to each other and separated by straits, which
were to the best of their estimation from twenty to an
hundred versts broad. Glottoff however did not land
till he reached the last and most Eastward of these islands,
called by the inhabitants Kadyak, from which the natives
said it was not far to the coast of a wide extended
woody continent. No land however was to be seen from
a little island called by the natives Aktunak, which is situated
about thirty versts more to the East than Kadyak.</p>


<p>September 8th, the vessel ran up a creek, lying South
East of Aktunak, through which a rivulet empties itself
into the sea; this rivulet comes from a lake six versts
long, one broad, and about fifty fathoms deep. During
the ebb of the tide the vessel was left aground; but the
return of the water set her again afloat. Near the shore
were four large huts, so crouded with people, that their
number could scarcely be counted: however, soon after
Glottoff's arrival, all these inhabitants quitted their dwellings,
and retired with precipitation. The next day some
islanders in baidars approached the vessel, and accosted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the people on board: and as Ivan Glottoff, the Ale&uuml;tian
interpreter, did not well understand the language of these
islanders, they soon afterwards returned with a boy whom
they had formerly taken prisoner from Isanak, one of
the islands which lie to the West of Kadyak. Him the
Ale&uuml;tian interpreter perfectly understood: and by his
means every necessary explanation could be obtained
from the islanders.</p>

<p>In this manner they conversed with the savages, and
endeavoured to persuade them to become tributary; they
used also every argument in their power to prevail upon
them to give up the boy for an interpreter; but all their
entreaties were for the present without effect. The savages
rowed back to the cliff called Aktalin, which lies
about three versts to the South of Kadyak, where they
seemed to have habitations.</p>

<p>On the 6th of September Kaplin was sent with thirteen
men to the cliff, to treat peaceably with the islanders.
He found there ten huts, from which about an hundred
of the natives came out. They behaved seemingly in a
friendly manner, and answered the interpreter by the
boy, that they had nobody proper for an hostage; but
that they would deliver up the boy to the Russians agreeable
to their desire. Kaplin received him very thankfully,
and brought him on board, where he was properly
taken care of: he afterwards accompanied Glottoff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
to Kamtchatka, and was baptized by the name of Alexander
Popoff, being then about thirteen years of age.
For some days after this conference the islanders came off
in companies of five, ten, twenty, and thirty: they
were admitted on board in small numbers, and kindly
received, but with a proper degree of circumspection.</p>

<p>On the 8th of September the vessel was brought further
up the creek without unloading her cargo: and on
the 9th Glottoff with ten men proceeded to a village on
the shore about two hundred yards from the vessel,
where the natives had begun to reside: it consisted of
three summer-huts covered only with long grass: they
were from eight to ten yards broad, twelve long, and
about four high: they saw there about an hundred men,
but neither women nor children.</p>

<p>Finding it impossible to persuade the savages to give
hostages, Glottoff resolved to let his people remain together,
and to keep a strong guard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Natives attack the Russians, but
are defeated.</div><p>The islanders visited them still in small bodies;
it was however more and more visible that their intentions were
bad. At last on the 1st of October, by day break, a
great number having assembled together in the remote
parts of the island, came unexpectedly across the country.
They approached very near without being discovered
by the watch, and seeing nobody on deck but those<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
on duty, shot suddenly into the vessel with arrows. The
watch found refuge behind the quarter boards, and gave
the alarm without firing. Glottoff immediately ordered
a volley to be fired over their heads with small arms;
upon which they immediately returned with great expedition.
As soon as it was day there was no enemy to be
seen: but they discovered a number of ladders, several
bundles of hay in which the savages had put sulphur,
likewise a quantity of birch-tree bark, which had been
left behind in their precipitate flight.</p>

<p>They now found it very necessary to be on their guard
against the attempts of these perfidious incendiaries.
Their suspicions were still further increased by the subsequent
conduct of the natives: for though the latter came
to the vessel in small bodies, yet it was observed that they
examined every thing, and more particularly the watch,
with the strictest attention; and they always returned
without paying any regard to the friendly propositions
of the Russians.</p>

<p>On the 4th of October about two hundred islanders
made their appearance, carrying wooden shields before
them, and preparing with bows and arrows for an attack.
Glottoff endeavoured at first by persuasion to prevail
upen them to desist; but observing that they still continued
advancing, he resolved to venture a sally. This
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>trepidity disconcerted the islanders, and they immediately
retreated without making the least resistance.</p>

<p>The 26th of October they ventured a third attack,
and advanced towards the vessel for this purpose by day-break:
the watch however gave the alarm in due time,
and the whole crew were immediately under arms. The
approach of day-light discovered to their view different
parties of the enemy advancing under the protection of
wooden screens. Of these moving breast-works they
counted seven; and behind each from thirty to forty
men armed with bone lances. Besides these a croud of
armed men advanced separately to the attack, some of
them bearing whale jaw-bones, and others wooden shields.
Dissuasion proving ineffectual, and the arrows beginning
to fall even aboard the ship, Glottoff gave orders to fire.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Natives are finally
repulsed by the Russians.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The
shot from the small arms however not being of force
enough to pierce the screens, the islanders advanced under
their protection with steadiness and intrepidity. Glottoff
nevertheless determined to risk a sally of his whole crew
armed with muskets and lances. The islanders instantly
threw down their screens, and fled with precipitation until
they gained their boats, into which they threw themselves
and rowed off. They had about seventeen large baidars
and a number of small canoes. The screens which they
left behind were made of three rows of stakes placed perpendicularly,
and bound together with sea-weed and osiers;
they were twelve feet broad, and above half a yard thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The Russians winter at Kadyak.</div><p>The
islanders now appearing to be sufficiently intimidated,
the Russians began to build a winter hut of floated
wood, and waited in a body the appearance of spring
without further annoyance. Although they saw nobody
before the 25th of December, yet Glottoff kept his people
together; sending out occasionally small hunting and
fishing parties to the lake, which lay about five versts
from the creek. During the whole winter they caught
in the lake several different species of trout and salmon,
soles, and herrings of a span and a half long, and even
turbot and cod-fish, which came up with the flood into
the lake.</p>

<p>At last, on the 25th of December, two islanders came
to the ship, and conversed at a distance by means of
interpreters. Although proposals of peace, and trade
were held out to them in the most friendly manner,
yet they went off without seeming to put much
confidence in these offers: nor did any of them
appear again before the 4th of April, 1764. Want
of sufficient exercise in the mean time brought on a
violent scurvy among the crew, by which disorder nine
persons were carried off.</p>

<p>On the 4th of April four islanders made their appearance,
and seemed to pay more attention to the proposals:
one of them at last advanced, and offered to barter
two fox-skins for beads. They did not set the least
va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>lue
upon other goods of various kinds, such as shirts,
linen, and nankeen, but demanded glass beads of different
colours, for which they exchanged their skins with
pleasure. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Natives
are reconciled to the Russians.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This friendly traffic, together with Glottoff's
entreaties, operated so powerfully, that, after holding a
consultation with their countrymen, they returned with
a solemn declaration, that their brethren would in future
commit no hostilities against the Russians. From that
time until their departure a daily intercourse was carried
on with the islanders, who brought all sorts of fox and
sea-otter skins, and received in exchange a stipulated
number of beads. Some of them were even persuaded
to pay a tribute of skins, for which receipts were given.</p>

<p>Amongst other wares the Russians procured two small
carpets, worked or platted in a curious manner, and on
one side set close with beaver-wool like velvet: they
could not however learn whether these carpets were
wrought by the islanders. The latter brought also for
sale well-dressed sea-otter skins, the hair of which was
shorn quite short with sharp stones, in such a manner,
that the remainder, which was of a yellowish brown
colour, glistened and appeared like velvet. Their caps
had surprising and sometimes very ornamental decorations:
some of them had on the forepart combs adorned
with manes like an helmet; others, seemingly peculiar
to the females, were made of intestines stitched together
with rein-deer hair and sinews in a most elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
taste, and ornamented on the crown with long streamers
of hair died of a beautiful red. Of all these curiosities
Glottoff carried samples to Kamtchatka<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Animals of Kadyak.</div><p>The natives differ
considerably in dress and language from the inhabitants of the other
Fox Islands: and several species of animals were observed upon
Kadyak, which are not to be found upon the other islands, viz.
ermines, martens, beavers, river otters, wolves, wild boars,
and bears: the last-mentioned animal was not indeed
actually seen by the Russians, but the prints of its feet
were traced. Some of the inhabitants had clothes made
of the skins of rein-deer and jevras; the latter of which
is a sort of small marmoset. Both these skins were probably
procured from the continent of America<a name="FNanchor_56_56"
id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. Black,
brown, and red foxes were seen in great numbers; and
the coast abounds with sea-dogs, sea-bears, sea-lions, and
sea-otters. The birds are cranes, geese, ducks, gulls,
ptarmigans, crows, and magpies; but no uncommon
species was any where discovered. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Productions.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> The vegetable
pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>ductions
are bilberries, cranberries, wortleberries, and
wild lily-roots. Kadyak likewise yields willows and alders,
which circumstance affords the strongest proof that
it lies at no great distance from the continent of America.
The extent of Kadyak cannot be exactly ascertained,
as the Russians, through apprehension of the natives, did
not venture to explore the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Account of the Inhabitants.</div><p>The
inhabitants, like those of the Ale&uuml;tian and nearer
islands, make holes in the under-lips and through the
gristle of the nose, in which they insert the bones of
birds and animals worked into the form of teeth. Their
clothes are made of the skins of birds, foxes, sea-otters,
young rein-deer, and marmosets; they sew them together
with sinews. They wear also fur-stockings of rein-deer
skins, but no breeches. Their arms are bows, arrows,
and lances, whose points, as well as their small hatchets,
are of sharp flint: some few make knives and lance
points of rein-deer bones. Their wooden shields are
called kuyaky, which amongst the Greenlanders signifies
a small canoe. Their manners are altogether rude.
They have not the least disposition to give a courteous
reception to strangers: nor does there appear amongst
themselves any kind of deference or submission from
one to another.</p>

<p>Their canoes are some of them so small as to contain
only one or two persons; others are large baidars similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to the women's boats of the Greenlanders. Their food
consists chiefly of raw and dried fish, partly caught at
sea with bone hooks, and partly in rivulets, in bagnets
made of sinews platted together. They call themselves
Kanagist, a name that has no small resemblance to
Karalit; by which appellation, the Greenlanders and Esquimaux
on the coast of Labradore distinguish themselves:
the difference between these two denominations is occasioned
perhaps by a change of pronunciation, or by a
mistake of the Russian sailors, who may have given it
this variation. Their numbers seem very considerable
on that part of the island, where they had their fixed
habitations.</p>

<p>The island Kadyak<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> makes, with Aghunalashka, Umnak,
and the small islands lying between them, a continued
Archipelago, extending N. E. and E. N. E. towards America:
it lies by the ship's reckoning in 230 degrees of
longitude; so that it cannot be far distant from that
part of the American coast which Beering formerly
touched at.</p>

<p>The large island Alaksu, lying Northward from Kadyak
where Pushkaref<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> wintered, must be still nearer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
continent: and the account propagated by its inhabitants
of a great promontory, called Atachtak, stretching from
the continent N. E. of Alaksu, is not at all improbable.</p>

<p>Although the conduct of the islanders appeared more
friendly, yet on account of their numbers Glottoff resolved
not to pass another winter upon Kadyak, and accordingly
prepared for his departure. He wanted hoops for repairing
his water-casks; and being told by the natives
that there were trees on the island at no great distance
from the bay, he dispatched on the 25th of April Lukas
Ftoruskin with eleven men for the purpose of felling
wood. Ftoruskin returned the same day with the following
intelligence: that after rowing along the South
coast of the island forty or fifty versts from the haven,
he observed, about half a verst from the shore, a considerable
number of alders, similar to those found in Kamtchatka,
growing in vallies between the rocks. The largest
trunks were from two to four vershocks in diameter.
Of this wood he felled as much as he had occasion for;
and returned without having met with either islander
or habitation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure from Kadyak, May, 1764.</div><p>They
brought the vessel down the creek in May; and,
after taking in all the peltry and stores, left Kadyak on
the 24th. Contrary winds retarded their voyage, and
drove them near the island Alaksu, which they passed;
their water being nearly exhausted, they
afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
landed upon another island, called Saktunk, in order
to procure a fresh stock. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Arrival at Umnak.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> At last on the 3d of July,
they arrived again at Umnak, and anchored in a bay
which Glottoff had formerly visited. He immediately
went ashore in a baidar, and soon found out his former
hut, which was in ruins: near it he observed another
Russian dwelling, that had been built in his absence,
in which lay a murdered Russian, but whose face none
of them knew. Glottoff, resolving to procure further information,
went across the island the 5th of July, accompanied
by sixteen of his crew. He discovered the remains
of a burnt vessel, some prayer books, images, &amp;c.; all the
iron work and cordage were carried off. Near the spot he
found likewise a bathing room filled with murdered Russians
in their clothes. From some marks, he concluded
that this was the vessel fitted out by Protassoff; nor was
he mistaken in his conjectures.</p>

<p>Alarmed at the fate of his countrymen, Glottoff returned
to the ship, and held a consultation upon the
measures necessary to be taken; and it was unanimously
resolved that they should endeavour to procure more
intelligence concerning the vessel. In the mean time
seven islanders came rowing off in baidars, and pretended
that they wanted to trade. They shewed sea-otter
skins at a distance, but would not venture on board;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and desired by the interpreter Glottoff and two of his
people to come on shore and barter. Glottoff however,
having sufficient cause to distrust the savages, refused
to comply with their demands: upon this they immediately
landed, and shot from the shore with fire-arms, but
without doing any execution. They were even bold enough
to get into their canoes a second time, and to row near the
vessel. In order if possible to procure intelligence from
them, every method of persuading them to peace was tried
by means of the interpreters; and at last one of them
approached the ship and demanded victuals, which being
thrown to him, he came on board. He then related the
fate of the above-mentioned vessel, of which the islanders
had made themselves masters; and gave likewise some intelligence
concerning the remaining small body of fugitives
under the command of Korovin. He also confessed,
that their design was to entice Glottoff on shore, and
then to kill him; for which purpose more than thirty
islanders were posted in ambush behind the nearest
rocks. After cutting off the leader, they imagined it
would be an easy matter to seize upon the ship. Upon
this information Glottoff detained the islander on
board, and landing with a strong party attacked the
savages; the latter shot with arrows, as well as from
the muskets which they had seized, but without effect,
and were soon forced to retire to their canoes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>July the 14th a violent storm arose, in which Glottoff's
vessel parted her cable, and was forced on shore
without any other loss than that of an anchor. The
crew likewise, through want of fresh provisions, began
to grow so sickly, that they were almost in a defenceless
state. Glottoff however, with ten men, set out the 28th
of July for that part of the island, where according to
information they expected to find Korovin. They discovered
only parts of the wreck, but none of the crew,
so that they now gave them up for lost. But on the
2d of August, as Glottoff was on his way back, five
islanders approached him in canoes, and asked why the
baidar had been out; to which a false answer being
given, they told him, that on the other side of the island
he would find Korovin with his people, who were
building an hut on the side of the rivulet. Upon receiving
this intelligence, Glottoff and his companions
went over land to the place pointed out by the islanders,
and found every thing agreeable to their information:
in this Korovin had not the least share, not having
been made privy to the transaction. The circumstances
of his joining, and afterwards separating from Glottoff,
have already been mentioned<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Glottoff winters upon Umnak.</div><p>Glottoff
now resolved to winter upon Umnak, and accordingly
laid up his vessel for that purpose. On the 2d
of September Korovin, as is before related, was at his
own desire sent out with a hunting party in two baidars.
On his return, in May 1765, they had the first intelligence
of the arrival of Solovioff's vessel, which lay before
Unalashka, and of which an account shall be given<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.
None of the islanders appeared near the harbour during
the winter, and there were none probably at that time
upon Umnak; for Glottoff made excursions on all sides,
and went once round the island. He likewise looked
into the habitations of the islanders, and found them
empty: he examined the country and caused a strict search
to be made after the remains of the plundered vessel.</p>

<p>According to his account Umnak is about 300 versts in
circumference. It contains several small rivulets, which
take their rise from lakes, and fall into the sea after a
very short course. No trees were observed upon the
island, and the vegetables were the same as those of
Kamtchatka.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>The following summer small parties of the inhabitants
were seen; but they immediately fled upon the approach
of the Russians. Some of them however were at last
persuaded to a friendly intercourse and to pay a tribute:
by these means they got back part of the arms, anchors,
and iron work, of the plundered vessel. They continued
to barter with the natives during the summer of 1765,
exchanging beads for the skins of foxes and sea-otters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure from Umnak.</div><p>The
following winter hunting parties were sent out
in Umnak as well as to Unalashka; and in July 1766
Glottoff, without meeting with any more difficulties
began his voyage homewards. We shall here conclude
with giving a copy of the journal kept on board Glottoff's
vessel, the Andrean and Natalia; from which inferences
with regard to the situation of the islands may be drawn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Solovioff in the St. Peter and Paul,
1764.</div><p>In the year 1764, Jacob Ulednikoff, merchant of Irkutsk
and company, fitted out a ship called the Holy
Apostles Peter and Paul, under the command of Ivan
Solovioff: she sailed from the mouth of Kamtchatka
river the 25th of August. The crew consisted of fifty-five
men, amongst whom were some of the owners,
and thirteen Kamtchadals.</p>

<p>They steered at first S. E. with the wind at N. W. but
on its coming southerly they afterwards shaped their
course E. N. E. The 27th one of the Russian sailors
died off Kamtchatka point; the 31st they made Beering's
Island, which they passed leaving it on their left. The
1st and 2nd of September they were becalmed, and afterwards
the wind springing up at W. S. W. they continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
their former course; until the 5th they sailed on with
the wind at south; but on the 5th and 6th, from
changeable breezes and dead calms, made no progress;
from the 7th to the 13th, they sailed E. S. E. with
Southerly and Westerly winds; and from that time to
the fifteenth East, with the wind at West.</p>

<p>September 16, they made the island Umnak, where
Solovioff had formerly been in Nikiphoroff's vessel. As
they sailed along the Northern coast, three islanders came
to them in baidars; but, the crew having no interpreter,
they would not come on board. As they found no good
bay on that shore, they proceeded through a strait of
about a verst broad, which separates Umnak from Unalashka.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Arrival at
Unalashka.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> They lay-to
during the night; and early on the 17th dropped anchor at the distance
of about two hundred yards from the shore, in a bay on the North
side of the last mentioned island.</p>

<p>From thence the captain dispatched Gregory Korenoff
at the head of twenty men in a baidar, with orders to
land, reconnoitre the country, find out the nearest habitations,
and report the disposition of the people. Korenoff
returned the same day, with an account that he had
discovered one of the dwelling-caves of the savages, but
abandoned and demolished, in which he had found traces
of Russians, viz. a written legend, and a broken musket-stock.
In consequence of this intelligence, they brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the ship near the coast, and endeavoured to get into the
mouth of a river called by the natives Tsikanok, and by
the Russians Osernia, but were prevented by shallow water.
They landed however their tackle and lading. No natives
made their appearance until the 22d, when two of
them came of their own accord, and welcomed the Russians
on their arrival. They told their names, and were
recognized by Solovioff; he had known them on a
former expedition, when Agiak, one of the two, had
served as an interpreter; the other, whose name was
Kashmak, had voluntarily continued some time with the
crew on the same occasion.</p>

<p>These two persons recounted the particular circumstances
which attended the loss of Kulkoff's, Protassoff's,
and Trapesnikoff's vessels; from the last of which Kashmak
had, with great hazard of his life, escaped by flight.
Agiak had served as interpreter to Protassoff's company,
and related that the islanders, after murdering the hunting
detachments of the Russians, came to the harbour,
and entered the ship under the most friendly appearances.
Finding the crew in perfect security, they suddenly attacked
and slew them, together with their commander.
He added, that he had hid himself under a bench until
the murderers were gone: that since that time, he, as
well as Kashmak, had lived as fugitives; and in the
course of their wanderings had learned the following
intelligence from the girls who were gathering berries in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the fields. The Toigons of Umnak, Akutan, and
Toshko, with their relations of Unalashka, had formed a
confederacy. They agreed not to disturb any Russians
on their first landing, but to let them go out on different
hunting excursions; being thus separated and weakened,
the intention of the Toigons were to attack and cut
them off at the same time, so that no one party should
have assistance from any of the others. They acquainted
him also with Glottoff's arrival at Umnak.</p>

<p>These unfavourable reports filled Solovioff with anxiety;
he accordingly doubled his watch, and used every
precaution in his power against attacks from the savages.
But wanting wood to repair his vessel, and wishing for
more particular information concerning the situation of
the island, he dispatched the 29th a party of thirty men,
with the above-mentioned interpreter, to its western extremity.
In three or four hours they rowed to Ankonom,
a point of land, where they saw a village, consisting
of two large caves, and over against it a little island at no
great distance. The moment the inhabitants saw them
approaching, they got into their baidars, and put out to
sea, leaving their dwellings empty. The Russians found
therein several skeletons, which, in the interpreter's
opinion, were the remains of ten murdered sailors of
Trapesnikoff's company. With much persuasion the
interpreter prevailed on the islanders to return to the place
which they had just quitted: they kept however at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
wary distance, and were armed for whatever might
occur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hostilities between Solovioff and the
Natives.</div><p>Solovioff attempting to cut off their retreat, in
order to secure if possible some hostages, they took the alarm,
and began themselves the attack. Upon this the Russians
fired upon and pursued them; four were killed, and
seven taken prisoners, among whom was the Toigon of
the little island Sedak. These prisoners, being bound
and examined, confessed that a number of Korovin's crew
had been murdered in this place; and the Toigon sent
people to bring in a number of muskets, some kettles
and tackle, which the natives had taken upon that occasion.
They also brought intelligence that Korovin, with
a party in two baidars, had taken shelter at a place called
Inalga. Upon this information, letters were immediately
sent to Korovin; upon the receipt of which he joined
them the 2d of October.</p>

<p>At the time of Korovin's arrival, the savages made
another attack on Solovioff's watch with knives; which
obliged the latter to fire, and six of the assailants were
left dead on the spot. The captive Toigon excused
this attempt of his people by ascribing it to their fears,
lest Korovin out of revenge should put all the prisoners to
death; on which account this effort was made to rescue
them. Solovioff, for the greater security, sent the prisoners
by land to the haven, while Korovin and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
party went to the same place by sea. The Toigon however
was treated kindly, and even permitted to return
home on condition of leaving his son as an hostage. In
consequence of this kind behaviour the inhabitants of
three other villages, Agulak, Kutchlok, and Makuski presented
hostages of their own accord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Solovioff lays up the Vessel, and winters upon
Unalashka.</div><p>From the remaining timber of the old dwelling the
Russians built a new hut; and on the fourteenth they
laid up the vessel. Koronoff was then sent upon a reconnoitring
party to the Southern side of the island, which
in that part was not more than five or six versts broad:
he proceeded on with his companions, sometimes rowing
in canoes, sometimes travelling by land and dragging
them after. He returned the twentieth, and reported
that he had found upon the coast on the further side of
the island an empty habitation. That he rowed from
thence Eastward along the shore, and behind the first point
of land came to an island in the next bay; there he found
about forty islanders of both sexes lodged under their
baidars, who by his friendly behaviour had been induced
to give him three hostages. These people afterwards
settled in the above-mentioned empty hut, and came frequently
to the harbour.</p>

<p>On the 28th of October, Solovioff himself went also
upon a reconnoitring party along the North coast, towards
the North-East end of the island. He rowed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
first promontory across a bay; and found on the opposite
point of land a dwelling place called Agulok, which lies
about four hours row from the harbour. He found there
thirteen men and about forty women and children, who
delivered up several gun-barrels and ship-stores, and likewise
informed him of two of Korovin's crew who had
been murdered.</p>

<p>November 5, they proceeded farther; and after five or
six hours rowing, they saw on a point of land another
dwelling called Ikutchlok, beyond which the interpreter
shewed them the haven, where Korovin's ship had been
at anchor. This was called Makushinshy Bay; and on
an island within it they found two Toigons, called Itchadak
and Kagumaga, with about an hundred and eighty
people of both sexes employed in hunting sea-bears.
These natives were not in the least hostile, and Solovioff
endeavoured to establish and confirm a friendly intercourse
between them and his people. He remained with them
until the 10th, when the Toigons invited him to their
winter quarters, which lay about five hours sail farther
East: there he found two dwelling caves, each of forty
yards square, near a rivulet abounding with fish which
fell from a lake into a little bay. In the neighbourhood
of this village is a hot spring below the sea mark, which
is only to be seen at ebb tide. From hence he departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the 25th, but was forced back by storms, and detained
there until the 6th of December.</p>

<p>Kagumaga then accompanied him to another village
called Totchikala; both the Toigon and the interpreter
advised him to be on his guard against the natives, whom
they represented as very savage, sworn enemies to the
Russians, and the murderers of nine of Kulkoff's crew.
Solovioff for these reasons passed the night on the open
coast, and next morning sent the Toigon before to inspire
the natives with more friendly sentiments. Some of
them listened to his representations; but the greatest part
fled upon Solovioff's approach, so that he found the place
consisting of four large dwelling caves almost empty, in
which he secured himself with suitable precaution. Here
he found three hundred darts and ten bows with arrows,
all which he destroyed, only reserving one bow and seventeen
arrows as specimens of their arms. By the most
friendly arguments he urged the few natives who remained
to lay aside their enmity, and to persuade their
leaders and relations to return to their habitations and
live on terms of amity and friendship.</p>

<p>On the 10th about an hundred men and a still greater
number of women returned. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Renewal of Hostilities.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> But the fairest speeches
had no effect on these savages, who kept aloof and prepared
for hostilities, which they began on the 17th by
an open attack. Nineteen of them were killed,
amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
whom was Inlogusak one of their leaders, and the most
inveterate fomenter of hostilities against the Russians.
The other leader Aguladock being alive confessed,
that on receiving the first news of Solovioff's arrival
they had resolved to attack the crew and burn the
ship. Notwithstanding this confession, no injury was
offered to him: in consequence of this kind usage he was
prevailed upon to deliver up his son as an hostage, and
to order his people to live on friendly terms with the
Russians. During the month of January the natives delivered
in three anchors, and a quantity of tackle which
had been saved from a vessel formerly wrecked on that
coast; and at the same time they brought three boys
and two young girls as hostages and pledges of their
future fidelity.</p>

<p>January 25, Solovioff set out for the haven where
his ship lay: before his departure the Toigons of Makushinsk
paid of their own accord a double tribute.</p>

<p>February 1, Kagumaga of Makushink, Agidalok of
Totzikala, and Imaginak of Ugamitzi, Toigons of Unalashka,
with a great number of their relations, came to
Solovioff; they acquainted him with the arrival of a Russian
ship at Unimak, the sixth island to the East of
Agunalashka, adding that they knew none of the crew
excepting a Kamtchadal named Kirilko, who had been
there on a former occasion. They likewise informed
him that the natives, after having cut off part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
crew who had been sent out in two baidars, had
found means to overpower the remainder and to destroy
the vessel. From the name of the Kamtchadal they concluded
that this must have been another vessel fitted out
by Nikiphor Trapesnikoff and company, of which no
farther intelligence was ever received. Willing to procure
farther intelligence, they endeavoured to persuade
the Toigons to send a party of their people to the above-mentioned
island; but the latter excused themselves, on
account of the great distance and their dread of the
islanders.</p>

<p>February 16, Solovioff set out a second time for the
West end of the island, where they had formerly taken
prisoner, and afterwards set at liberty, the Toigon of
Sedak. From thence he proceeded to Ikolga, which
lies on the bay, and consists of only one hut. On the
26th he came to Takamitka, where there is likewise
only one hut on a point of land by the side of a rivulet,
which falls from the mountains into the sea. Here he
met with Korovin, in whose company he cut the blubber
of a whale, which the waves had cast on shore; after
this Korovin went across the gulph to Umnak, and he
proceeded to Ikaltshinsk, where on the 9th one of his
party was carried off by sickness.</p>

<p>March 15 he returned to the haven, having met with
no opposition from the islanders during this excursion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>On his return he found one of the crew dead, and a
dreadful scurvy raging amongst the rest; of that distemper
five Russians died in March, eight and a Kamtchadal
in April, and six more in May. About this time the islanders
were observed to pay frequent visits to the hostages;
and upon enquiring privately into the reason, some of
the latter discovered, that the inhabitants of Makushinsk
had formed the design of cutting off the crew, and of
making themselves masters of the vessel. Solovioff had
now great reasons to be apprehensive, for the crew were
afflicted with the scurvy to such a violent degree, that out
of the whole number only twelve persons were capable
of defending themselves. These circumstances did not
escape the observation of the natives; and they were accordingly
inspired with fresh courage to renew their
hostilities.</p>

<p>On the 27th of May the Russians perceived the Toigon
of Itchadak, who had formerly paid a voluntary tribute,
near the shore: he was accompanied by several islanders
in three baidars. Solovioff calling to him by the interpreter
he came on shore, but kept at a distance desiring
a conference with some of his relations. Solovioff gave
orders to seize him; and they were lucky enough to take
him prisoner, together with two of his companions. He
immediately confessed, that he had come with a view of
enquiring of the hostages how many Russians were still
remaining: having procured the necessary intelligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
his intention was to surprise the watch at a convenient
season, and afterwards to set fire to the ship. As they
saw several islanders row past the harbour at the same
time, and the Toigon likewise informed them, that they
were assembling to execute the abovementioned design;
Solovioff resolved to be much upon his guard. They
separated, however, without attempting any hostilities.</p>

<p>June 5, Glottoff arrived at the harbour on a visit, and
returned on the 8th to his ship. The captive Toigon
was now set at liberty, after being seriously exhorted to
desist from hostilities. In the course of this month two
more of the crew died; so that the arrival of Korovin,
who joined them about this time, with two of his own
and two of Kulkoff's crew, was of course a very agreeable
circumstance. The sick likewise began to recover
by degrees.</p>

<p>July 22, Solovioff, with a party of his people, in two
baidars, made another excursion Northwards; he passed
by the places formerly mentioned as far as Igonok,
which lies ten versts beyond Totzikala. Igonok consists
of one dwelling cave on the side of a rivulet, which falls
from the mountains, and empties itself into the sea. The
inhabitants amounted to about thirty men, who dwelt
there with their wives and children. From thence
Solovioff proceeded along the shore into a bay; five versts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
further he found another rivulet, which has its source
among the hills and flows through a plain.</p>

<p>Upon the shore of the same bay, opposite to the
mouth of this rivulet, lay two villages, one of which
only was inhabited; it was called Ukunadok, and consisted
of six dwelling caves. About thirty-five of the
inhabitants were at that time employed in catching salmon
in the rivulet. Kulkoff's ship had lain at anchor
about two miles from thence; but there were no remains
of her to be found. After coming out of the bay
he went forwards to the summer village Umgaina distant
about seven or eight leagues, and situated on the side
of a rivulet, which takes its rise in a lake abounding with
salmon. Here he found the Toigon Amaganak, with
about ten of the natives, employed in fishing. Fifteen
versts farther along the shore they found another summer
village called Kalaktak, where there was likewise
another rivulet, which came from the hills. The inhabitants
were sixty men and an hundred and seventy
women and children: they gave Solovioff a very friendly
reception; and delivered up two hostages, who were
brought from the neighbouring island Akutan; with
these he set out on his return, and on the 6th of August
joined his crew.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 11th he went over to the island Umnak, accompanied
by Korovin, to bring off some ships stores
left there by the latter; and returned to the haven on
the 27th. On the 31st Shaffyrin died, the same person
whose adventures have been already related.</p>

<p>Sept. 19. Korenoff was sent northwards upon an
hunting party; he returned the 30th of January, 1766.
Although the Russians who remained at the haven met
with no molestation from the natives during his absence;
yet he and his companions were repeatedly attacked.
Having distributed to the inhabitants of the several villages
through which he passed nets for the purpose of
catching sea-otters, he went to the East part of the island
as far as Kalaktak, with an intention of hunting. Upon
his arrival at that place, on the 31st of October, the inhabitants
fled with precipitation; and as all his efforts to
conciliate their affections were ineffectual, he found it requisite
to be upon his guard. Nor was this precaution unnecessary;
for on the following day they returned in a
considerable body, armed with lances, made with the
iron of the plundered vessels. Korenoff, however, and
his companions, who were prepared to receive them,
killed twenty-six, and took several prisoners; upon
which the others became more tractable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<p>Nov. 19. Korenoff, upon his return to the haven, came
to Makushinsk, where he was kindly received by a Toigon
named Kulumaga; but with regard to Itchadak, it was plain
that his designs were still hostile. Instead of giving an
account of the nets which had been left with him, he
withdrew privately: and on the 19th of January, accompanied
by a numerous body of islanders, made an attempt
to surprise the Russians. Victory, however, again
declared for Korenoff; and fifteen of the assailants,
amongst whom was Itchadak himself, remained dead
upon the spot. Kulumaga assured them, in the strongest
manner, that the design had been carried on without his
knowledge; and protested, that he had often prevented
his friend from committing hostilities against the Russians.</p>

<p>Korenoff returned to the haven on the 30th of January;
and on the 4th of February he went upon another
hunting expedition toward the Western point of the island.
During this excursion he met with a party sent out by
Glottoff, at a place called Takamitka; he then rowed
over to Umnak, where he collected a small tribute, and
returned on the 3d of March. During his absence
Kyginik, Kulumaga's son, paid a visit to the Russians, and
requested that he might be baptized, and be permitted to
go aboard the vessel; his demand was immediately complied
with.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<p>May 13th. Korovin went, with fourteen men, to
Umnak, to bring off an anchor, which was buried in the
sand. On his return preparations were made for their
departure. Before the arrival of Korovin the hunters
had killed 150 black and brown foxes; and the same
number of old and young sea-otters; since his arrival
they had caught 350 black foxes, the same number of
common foxes, and 150 sea-otters of different sizes.</p>

<p>This cargo being put on board, the interpreter Kashmak
set at liberty, with a certificate of, and presents for
his fidelity, and the hostages delivered up to the Toigons
and their relations, who had assembled at the haven,
Solovioff put to sea on the 1st of June, with an Easterly
wind. Before his departure he received a letter from
Glottoff, informing him that he was likewise preparing
for his return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Solovioff's Description of the
Fox Islands.</div><p>Solovioff's description of these islands and
the inhabitants being more circumstantial, than the accounts
given by former navigators, deserves to be inserted at
full length. According to his estimation, the island
Unalashka lies between 1500 and 2000 versts due East
from the mouth of the Kamtchatka river: the other
islands to the Eastward stretch towards N. E. He reckons
the length of Akutan at eighty versts; Umnak at
an hundred and fifty, and Unalashka at two hundred. No
large trees were seen upon any of the islands which he
touched at. They produce underwood, small shrubs, and
plants, for the most part similar to the common species
found in Kamtchatka. The winter is much milder than
in the Eastern parts of Siberia, and continues only from
November to the end of March. The snow seldom lies
upon the ground for any time.</p>

<p>Rein-deer, bears, wolves, ice-foxes, are not to be
found on these islands; but they abound in black, grey,
brown, and red foxes; for which reason they have got
the name of Lyffie Ostrova, or Fox Islands. These foxes
are stronger than those of Yakutsk, and their hair is
much coarser. During the day they lie in caves and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
clifts of rocks; towards evening they come to the shore
in search of food; they have long ago extirpated the
brood of mice, and other small animals. They are not
in the smallest degree afraid of the inhabitants, but distinguish
the Russians by the scent; having experienced
the effects of their fire-arms. The number of sea-animals,
such as sea-lions, sea-bears, and sea-otters, which
resort to these shores, are very considerable. Upon some
of the islands warm springs and native sulphur are to be
found.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manners and Customs of the
Inhabitants.</div><p>The Fox-islands are in general very populous;
Unalashka, which is the largest island, is supposed to contain
several thousand inhabitants. These savages live together
in separate communities, composed of fifty, and sometimes
of two or even three hundred persons; they dwell
in large caves from forty to eighty yards long, from six
to eight broad, and from four to five high. The roof of
these caves is a kind of wooden grate, which is first spread
over with a layer of grass, and then covered with earth.
Several openings are made in the iop, through which
the inhabitants go up and down by ladders: the smallest
dwellings have two or three entrances of this sort, and
the largest five or six. Each cave is divided into a certain
number of partitions, which are appropriated to the several
families; and these partitions are marked by means
of stakes driven into the earth. The men and women sit<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
on the ground; and the children lie down, having their
legs bound together under them, in order to make them
learn to sit upon their hams.</p>

<p>Although no fire is ever made in these caves, they
are generally so warm, that both sexes sit naked.
These people obey the calls of nature openly, and without
esteeming it indecent. They wash themselves first
with their own urine, and afterwards with water. In
winter they go always bare-footed; and when they
want to warm themselves, especially before they go to
sleep, they set fire to dry grass and walk over it. Their
habitations being almost dark, they use particularly in
winter a sort of large lamps, made by hollowing out a
stone, into which they put a rush-wick and burn train
oil. A stone so hollowed is called Tsaaduck. The natives<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
are whites with black hair; they have flat faces,
and are of a good stature. The men shave with a sharp
stone or knife, the circumference and top of the head,
and let the hair which remains hang from the crown<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.
The women cut their hair in a streight line over the forehead;
behind they let it grow to a considerable length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and tie it in a bunch. Some of the men wear their beards;
others shave or pull them out by the roots.</p>

<p>They mark various figures on their faces, the backs
of their hands, and lower parts of their arms, by pricking
them first with a needle, and then rubbing the parts
with a sort of black clay. They make three incisions in
the under-lip; they place in the middle one a flat bone,
or a small coloured stone; and in each of the side-ones
they fix a long pointed piece of bone, which
bends and reaches almost to the ears. They likewise
make a hole through the gristle of the nose, into which
they put a small piece of bone in such a manner as
to keep the nostrils extended. They also pierce holes
in their ears, and wear in them what little ornaments
they can procure.</p>

<p>Their dress consists of a cap and a fur-coat, which
reaches down to the knee. Some of them wear common
caps of a party coloured bird-skin, upon which
they leave part of the wings and tail. On the fore-part
of their hunting and fishing caps they place a small
board like a screen, adorned with the jaw-bones of sea-bears,
and ornamented with glass beads, which they receive
in barter from the Russians. At their festivals and
dancing parties they use a much more showy sort of caps.
Their fur-coats are made like shirts, being close behind
and before, and are put on over the head. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
mens dress is made of birds skins, but the womens of
sea-otters and sea-bears. These skins are died with a
sort of red earth, and neatly sewed with sinews, and
ornamented with various stripes of sea-otter skins and
leathern fringes. They have also upper garments made
of the intestines of the largest sea-calves and sea-lions.</p>

<p>Their vessels consist of two sorts: the larger are leathern
boats or baidars, which have oars on both sides,
and are capable of holding thirty or forty people. The
smaller vessels are rowed with a double paddle, and resemble
the canoes of the Greenlanders, containing only
one or two persons: they never weigh above thirty
pounds, being nothing but a thin skeleton of a boat
covered with leather. In these however they pass from
one island to another, and even venture out to sea to a
considerable distance. In calm weather they go out in
them to catch turbot and cod with bone-hooks and lines
made of sinews or sea-weed. They strike fish in the
rivulets with darts. Whales and other sea-animals
thrown ashore by the waves are carefully looked after,
and no part of them is lost. The quantity of provisions
which they procure by hunting and fishing
being far too small for their wants, the greatest part of
their food consists of sea-wrack and shell-fish, which
they find on the shore.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p>No stranger is allowed to hunt or fish near a village,
or to carry off any thing fit for food. When they are
on a journey, and their provisions are exhausted, they
beg from village to village, or call upon their friends
and relations for assistance.</p>

<p>They feed upon the flesh of all sorts of sea-animals,
and generally eat it raw. But if at any time they
choose to dress their victuals, they make use of an hollow
stone; having placed the fish or flesh therein, they
cover it with another, and close the interstices with
lime or clay. They then lay it horizontally upon two
stones, and light a fire under it. The provision which
is intended for keeping is dried without salt in the
open air. They gather berries of various sorts, and
lily roots of the same species with those which grow
wild at Kamtchatka. They are unacquainted with the
manner of dressing the cow-parsnip, as practised in that
Peninsula; and do not understand the art of distilling
brandy or any other strong liquor from it. They are
at present very fond of snuff, which the Russians have
introduced among them.</p>

<p>No traces were found of any worship, neither did
they seem to have any sorcerers<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> among them. If a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
whale happens to be cast on shore, the inhabitants assemble
with great marks of joy, and perform a number
of extraordinary ceremonies. They dance and beat
drums<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of different sizes: they then cut up the fish,
of which the greatest and best part is consumed on
the spot. On such occasions they wear showy caps;
and some of them dance naked in wooden masks, which
reach down to their shoulders, and represent various sorts
of sea-animals. Their dances consist of short steps forwards,
accompanied with many strange gestures.</p>

<p>Marriage ceremonies are unknown among them,
and each man takes as many wives as he can maintain;
but the number seldom exceeds four. These women
are occasionally allowed to cohabit with other men;
they and their children are also not unfrequently bartered
in exchange for commodities. When an islander
dies, the body is bound with thongs, and afterwards exposed
to the air in a sort of wooden cradle hung upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
a cross-bar, supported by forks. Upon these occasions
they cry and make bitter lamentations.</p>

<p>Their Toigons or Princes are those who have numerous
families, and are skilful and successful in hunting
and fishing.</p>

<p>Their weapons consist of bows, arrows, and darts:
they throw the latter very dexterously, and to a great
distance from a hand-board. For defence they use
wooden shields, called kuyakin. These islanders are,
notwithstanding their savageness, very docile; and the
boys, whom the Russians keep as hostages, soon acquire
a knowledge of their language.</p>

<i>Voyage of</i> Otcheredin&mdash;<i>He winters upon</i> Umnak&mdash;<i>Arrival
of</i> Levasheff <i>upon</i> Unalashka&mdash;<i>Return of</i> Otcheredin <i>to</i>
Ochotsk.</h4>


<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Otcheredin in the St. Paul,
1765.</div><p>In the year 1765 three merchants, namely, Orechoff
of Yula, Lapin of Solikamsk, and Shiloff of Ustyug,
fitted out a new vessel called the St. Paul, under
the command of Aphanassei Otcheredin. She was built
in the harbour of Ochotsk: his crew consisted of sixty-two
Russians and Kamtchadals, and she carried on board
two inhabitants of the Fox Islands named John and Timothy
Surgeff, who had been brought to Kamtchatka
and baptised.</p>

<p>September 10, they sailed from Ochotsk, and arrived
the 22d in the bay of Bolcheresk where they wintered.
August 1, 1776, they continued their voyage, and
having passed the second of the Kuril Isles, steered on the
6th into the open sea; on the 24th they reached the
nearest of the Fox Islands, which the interpreters
called<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Atchak. A storm arising they cast anchor in a bay,
but saw no inhabitants upon the shore. <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Arrival at
Umnak.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> On the
26th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
they sailed again, discovered on the 27th Sagaugamak,
along which they steered North East, and on the 31st
came within seven miles of the island Umnak; where,
on account of the lateness of the season and the want of
provision and water, they determined to winter. Accordingly
on the 1st of September, by the advice of the
interpreters, they brought the vessel into a convenient
bay near a point of land lying N. W. where they fastened
it to the shore with cables.</p>

<p>Upon their landing they discovered several pieces of a
wreck; and two islanders, who dwelled on the banks of
a rivulet which empties itself into the bay, informed
them, that these were the remains of a Russian vessel,
whose commander's name was Denys. From this intelligence
they concluded that this was Protassoff's vessel,
fitted out at Ochotsk. The inhabitants of Umnak, Unalashka,
and of the Five Mountains, had assembled and
murdered the crew, when separated into different hunting
parties. The same islanders also mentioned the fate
of Kulkoff's and Trapesnikoff's ships upon the island
Unalashka. Although this information occasioned general
apprehensions, yet they had no other resource than
to draw the vessel ashore, and to take every possible precaution
against a surprize. Accordingly they kept a constant
watch, made presents to the Toigons and the principal
inhabitants, and demanded some children as hostages.
For some time the islanders behaved very peaceably, until
the Russians endeavoured to persuade them to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
tributary: upon which they gave such repeated signs of
their hostile intentions, that the crew lived under continual
alarms. In the beginning of September information
was brought them of the arrival of a vessel, fitted
out by Ivan Popoff merchant of Lalsk, at Unalashka.</p>

<p>About the end of the said month the Toigon of the
Five Mountains came to Otcheredin, and was so well satisfied
with his reception, that he brought hostages, and
not only assured them of his own friendship, but promised
to use his influence with the other Toigons, and
to persuade them to the same peaceable behaviour. But
the other Toigons not only paid no regard to his persuasions,
but even barbarously killed one of his children.
From these and other circumstances the crew passed the
winter under continual apprehensions, and durst not venture
far from the harbour upon hunting parties. Hence
ensued a scarcity of provisions; and hunger, joined to
the violent attacks of the scurvy, made great havock
amongst them, insomuch that six of them died, and several
of the survivors were reduced to so weak a condition,
that they were scarce able to move.</p>

<p>The health of the crew being re-established in the
spring, twenty-three men were sent on the 25th of
June in two boats to the Five Mountains, in order to
persuade the inhabitants to pay tribute. On the 26th
they landed on the island Ulaga, where they were
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>tacked with great spirit by a large body of the inhabitants;
and though three of the Russians were wounded,
yet the savages were repulsed with considerable loss: they
were so terrified by their defeat, that they fled before the
Russians during their continuance on that island. The
latter were detained there by tempestuous weather until
the 9th of July; during which time they found two
rusty firelocks belonging to Protassoff's crew. On the
10th they returned to the harbour; and it was immediately
resolved to dispatch some companies upon hunting
expeditions.</p>

<p>Accordingly on the 1st of August Matthew Poloskoff,
a native of Ilinsk, was sent with twenty-eight men in
two boats to Unalashka with the following orders;
that if the weather and other circumstances were favourable,
they were to make to Akutan and Akun, the
two nearest islands to the East, but to proceed no further.
In consequence of this, Poloskoff reached Akutan about
the end of the month; and being kindly received by
the inhabitants, he left six of his party to hunt; with
the remainder he went to Akun, which lies about two
versts from Akutan. From thence he dispatched five
men to the neighbouring islands, where he was informed
by the interpreters there were great quantities of foxes.</p>

<p>Poloskoff and his companions continued the whole
autumn upon Akun without being annoyed; but on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
12th of December the inhabitants of the different islands
assembled in great numbers, and attacked them by land
and sea. They informed Poloskoff, by means of the
interpreters, that the Russians whom he had sent to
the neighbouring islands were killed; that the two
vessels at Umnak and Unalashka were plundered, and
the crew put to death; and that they were now come
to make him and his party share the same fate. The
Russian fire-arms however kept them in due respect;
and towards evening they dispersed. The same night
the interpreter deserted, probably at the instigation of
his countrymen, who nevertheless killed him, as it was
said, that winter.</p>

<p>January 16, the savages ventured to make a second
attack. Having surprised the guard by night, they tore
off the roof of the Russian dwelling, and shot down
into the hut, making at the same time great outcries:
by this unexpected assault four Russians were killed,
and three wounded; but the survivors no sooner had
recourse to their fire-arms, than the enemy was driven
to flight. Meanwhile another body of the natives attempted
to seize the two vessels, but without success;
they however cut off the party of six men left by Poloskoff
at Akutan, together with the five hunters dispatched
to the contiguous islands, and two of Popoff's
crew who were at the Westermost part of Unalashka.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>Poloskoff continued upon Akun in great danger until
the 20th of February; when, the wounded being recovered,
he sailed over with a fair wind to Popoff's vessel
at Unalashka; and on the 10th of May returned to
Otcheredin.</p>

<p>In April Popoff's vessel being got ready for the voyage,
all the hostages, whose number amounted to forty,
were delivered to Otcheredin. July the 30th a vessel
belonging to the same Popoff arrived from Beering's
Island, and cast anchor in the same bay where Otcheredin's
lay; and both crews entered into an agreement
to share in common the profits of hunting. Strengthened
by this alliance, Otcheredin prevailed upon a number
of the inhabitants to pay tribute. August the 22d
Otcheredin's mate was sent with six boats and fifty-eight
men to hunt upon Unalashka and Akutan; and
there remained thirty men with the vessels in the harbour,
who kept constant watch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Otcheredin receives an Account of Levasheff's
Arrival at Unalashka.</div><p>Soon afterwards Otcheredin and the other
commander received a letter from Levasheff Captain Lieutenant of
the Imperial fleet, who accompanied Captain Krenitzin
in the secret expedition to those islands. The letter
was dated September 11, 1768: it informed them he
was arrived at Unalashka in the St. Paul, and lay at
anchor in the same bay in which Kulkoff's vessel had<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
been lost. He likewise required a circumstantial account
of their voyages. By another order of the 24th
he sent for four of the principal hostages, and demanded
the tribute of skins which had been exacted from the
islanders. But as the weather was generally tempestuous
at this season of the year, they deferred sending them
till the spring. May the 31st Levasheff set sail for
Kamtchatka; and in 1771 returned safely from his expedition
at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>The two vessels remained at Umnak until the year
1770, during which time the crews met with no opposition
from the islanders. They continued their hunting
parties, in which they had such good fortune, that
the share of Otcheredin's vessel (whose voyage is here
chiefly related) consisted in 530 large sea-otter skins,
40 young ones and 30 cubs, the skins of 656 fine black
foxes, 100 of an inferior sort, and about 1250 red fox
skins.</p>

<p>With this large cargo of furs Otcheredin set sail on the
22d of May, 1770, from Umnak, leaving Popoff's crew
behind. A short time before their departure, the other
interpreter Ivan Surgeff, at the instigation of his relations,
deserted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of Otcheredin to
Ochotsk.</div><p>After having touched at the nearest of the
Ale&uuml;tian Islands, Otcheredin and his crew arrived on the 24th
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
July at Ochotsk. They brought two islanders with
them, whom they baptized. The one was named
Alex&egrave;y Solovieff; the other Boris Otcheredin. These
islanders unfortunately died on their way to Petersburg;
the first between Yakutsk and Irkutsk; and the latter
at Irkutsk, where he arrived on the 1st of February,
1771.</p>

description of the dress, manners, and customs of
the inhabitants&mdash;their feasts and ceremonies, &amp;c.</i></h4>


<div class="sidenote">Position of Beering's and Copper
Islands.</div><p>According to the latest informations brought
by Otcheredin's and Popoff's vessels, the North
West point of Commandorskoi Ostroff, or Beering's
Island, lies due East from the mouth of the Kamtchatka
river, at the distance of 250 versts. It is from 70 to
80 versts long, and stretches from North West to South
East, in the same direction as Copper Island. The latter
is situated about 60 or 70 versts from the South East
point of Beering's Island, and is about 50 versts in length.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of the Ale&uuml;tian Isles.</div><p>About
300 versts East by South of Copper Island lie
the Ale&uuml;tian Isles, of which Attak is the nearest: it is
rather larger than Beering's Island, of the same
shape, and stretches from West to South East. From
thence about 20 versts Eastwards is situated Semitshi,
extending from West to East, and near its Eastern point
another small island. To the South of the strait, which
separates the two latter islands, and at the distance
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
40 versts from both of them, lies Shemiya in a similar
position, and not above 25 versts in length. All these
islands stretch between 54 and 55 degrees of North
latitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of the Fox Islands.</div><p>The Fox Islands
are situated E. N. E. from the Ale&uuml;tians:
the nearest of these, Atchak, is about 800 versts
distant; it lies in about 56 degrees North latitude, and extends
from W. S. W. towards E. N. E. It greatly resembles
Copper Island, and is provided with a commodious
harbour on the Notrh. From thence all the other islands of this
chain stretch in a direction towards N. E. by East.</p>

<p>The next to Atchak is Amlak, about 15 versts distant;
it is nearly of the same size; and has an harbour
on its South side. Next follows Sagaugamak, at about
the same distance, but somewhat smaller; from that it
is 50 versts to Amuchta, a small rocky island; and the
same distance from the latter to Yunaksan, another small
island. About 20 versts from Yunaksan there is a cluster
of five small islands, or rather mountains, Kigalgist,
Kagamila, Tsigulak, Ulaga, and Tana-Unok, and which
are therefore called by the Russians P&auml;t Sopki, or the
Five Mountains. Of these Tana-Unok lies most to the
N. E. towards which the Western point of Umnak advances
within the distance of 20 versts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p>Umnak stretches from S. W. to N. E.; it is 150 versts
in length, and has a very considerable bay on the West
end of the Northern coast, in which there is a small
island or rock, called Adugak; and on the South side is
Shemalga, another rock. The Western point of Aghunalashka,
or Unalashka, is separated from the East end of
Umnak by a strait near 20 versts in breadth. The position
of these two islands is similar; but Aghunalashka
is much the largest, and is above 200 versts long. It is
divided towards the N. E. into three promontories, one
of which runs out in a Westerly direction, forming one
side of a large bay on the North coast of the island:
the second stretches out N. E. ends in three points, and
is connected with the island by a small neck of land.
The third or most Southerly one is separated from the
last mentioned promontory by a deep bay. Near Unalashka
towards the East lies another small island called
Skirkin.</p>

<p>About 20 versts from the North East promontory of
Aghunalashka lie four islands: the first, Akutan, is
about half as big as Umnak; a verst further is the small
island Akun; a little beyond is Akunok; and lastly Kigalga,
which is the smallest of these four, and stretches
with Akun and Akunok almost from N. to S. Kigalga
is situated about the 61st degree of latitude. About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
100 versts from thence lies an island called Unimak<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>,
upon which Captain Krenitzin wintered; and beyond it
the inhabitants said there was a large tract of country
called Alashka, of which they did not know the boundaries.</p>

<p>The Fox Islands are in general very rocky, without
containing any remarkable high mountains: they are
destitute of wood, but abound in rivulets and lakes,
which are mostly without fish. The winter is much
milder than in Siberia; the snow seldom falls before
the beginning of January, and continues on the ground
till the end of March.</p>

<p>There is a volcano in Amuchta; in Kagamila sulphur
flows from a mountain; in Taga-Unok there are warm
springs hot enough to boil provisions; and flames of
sulphur are occasionally seen at night upon the mountains
of Unalashka and Akutan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Account of the Inhabitants of the Fox
Islands.</div><p>The Fox Islands are tolerably populous in proportion
to their size. The inhabitants are entirely free, and pay
tribute to no one: they are of a middle stature; and
live, both in summer and winter, in holes dug in the
earth. No signs of religion were found amongst
them. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg
168]</a></span>Several persons indeed pass for sorcerers, pretending
to know things past and to come, and are accordingly
held in high esteem, but without receiving any emolument.
Filial duty and respect towards the aged are
not held in estimation by these islanders. They are
not however deficient in fidelity to each other; they
are of lively and chearful tempers, though rather impetuous,
and naturally prone to anger. In general they
do not observe any rules of decency, but follow all the
calls of nature publicly, and without the least reserve.
They wash themselves with their own urine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their Food.</div><p>Their principal food
consists in fish and other sea-animals, small shell-fish and
sea-plants: their greatest delicacies are wild lilies and other
roots, together with different kinds of berries. When they have
laid in a store of provisions, they eat at any time of the
day without distinction; but in case of necessity they
are capable of fasting several days together. They seldom
heat their dwellings; but when they are desirous
of warming themselves, they light a bundle of hay, and
stand over it; or else they set fire to train oil, which
they pour into a hollow stone.</p>

<p>They feed their children when very young with the
coarsest flesh, and for the most part raw. If an infant
cries, the mother immediately carries it to the sea-side,
and be it summer or winter holds it naked in the
wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>ter
until it is quiet. This custom is so far from doing
the children any harm, that it hardens them against
the cold; and they accordingly go bare-footed through
the winter without the least inconvenience. They are
also trained to bathe frequently in the sea; and it is
an opinion generallly received among the islanders, that
by that means they are rendered bold, and become fortunate
in fishing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dress.</div><p>The men wear shirts made of
the skins of cormorants, sea-divers, and gulls; and, in order to
keep out the rain, they have upper garments of the bladders and
other intestines of sea-lions, sea-calves, and whales,
blown up and dried. They cut their hair in a circular
form close to their ears; and shave also a round place
upon the top. The women, on the contrary, let the
hair descend over the forehead as low as the eye-brows,
and tie the remaining part in a knot upon the top of
the head. They pierce the ears, and hang therein
bits of coral which they get from the Russians. Both
sexes make holes in the gristle of the nose, and in
the under-lips, in which they thrust pieces of bone,
and are very fond of such kind of ornaments. They
mark also and colour their faces with different figures.
They barter among one another sea-otters, sea-bears,
clothes made of bird-skins and of dried intestines, skins
of sea-lions and sea-calves for the coverings of
baidars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
wooden masks, darts, thread made of sinews and reindeer
hair, which they get from the country of Alaska.</p>

<p>Their houshold utensils are square pitchers and large
troughs, which they make out of the wood driven ashore
by the sea. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Arms.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> Their weapons are bows
and arrows pointed with flints, and javelins of two yards in length,
which they throw from a small board. Instead of hatchets they
use crooked knives of flint or bone. Some iron knives,
hatchets, and lances, were observed amongst them, which
they had probably got by plundering the Russians.</p>

<p>According to the reports of the oldest inhabitants of
Umnak and Unalashka, they have never been engaged
in any war either amongst themselves or with their
neighbours, except once with the people of Alashka, the
occasion of which was as follows: The Toigon of Umnak's
son had a maimed hand; and some inhabitants of
Alashka, who came upon a visit to that island, fastened
to his arm a drum, out of mockery, and invited him to
dance. The parents and relations of the boy were offended
at this insult: hence a quarrel ensued; and from
that time the two people have lived in continual enmity,
attacking and plundering each other by turns. According
to the reports of the islanders, there are mountains
upon Alashka, and woods of great extent at some distance
from the coast. The natives wear clothes made
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the skins of reindeer, wolves, and foxes, and are not
tributary to any of their neighbours. The inhabitants
of the Fox-islands seem to have no knowledge of any
country beyond Alashka.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feasts.</div><p>Feasts are very common
among these islanders; and more particularly when the inhabitants
of one island are visited by those of the others. The men of
the village meet their guests beating drums, and preceded by the
women, who sing and dance. At the conclusion of the
dance the hosts invite them to partake of the feasts; after
which ceremony the former return first to their dwellings,
place mats in order, and serve up their best provision.
The guests next enter, take their places, and
after they are satisfied the diversions begin.</p>

<p>First, the children dance and caper, at the same time
making a noise with their small drums, while the owners
of the hut of both sexes sing. Next, the men dance
almost naked, tripping after one another, and beating
drums of a larger size: when these are weary, they are
relieved by the women, who dance in their clothes, the
men continuing in the mean time to sing and beat their
drums. At last the fire is put out, which had been kindled
for the ceremony. The manner of obtaining fire is
by rubbing two pieces of dry wood, or most commonly by
striking two flints together, and letting the sparks fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
upon some sea-otter's hair mixed with sulphur. If any
sorcerer is present, it is then his turn to play his tricks in
the dark; if not, the guests immediately retire to their
huts, which are made on that occasion of their canoes
and mats. The natives, who have several wives, do not
withhold them from their guests; but where the owner
of the hut has himself but one wife, he then makes the
offer of a female servant.</p>

<p>Their hunting season is principally from the end of
October to the beginning of December, during which
time they kill large quantities of young sea-bears for their
clothing. They pass all December in feastings and diversions
similar to that above mentioned: with this difference,
however, that the men dance in wooden masks,
representing various sea-animals, and painted red, green,
or black, with coarse coloured earths found upon these
islands.</p>

<p>During these festivals they visit each other from village
to village, and from island to island. The feasts
concluded, masks and drums are broken to pieces, or deposited
in caverns among the rocks, and never afterwards
made use of. In spring they go out to kill old sea-bears,
sea-lions, and whales. During summer, and even
in winter when it is calm, they row out to sea, and catch
cod and other fish. Their hooks are of bone; and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
lines they make use of a string made of a long tenacious
sea-weed, which is sometimes found in those seas near one
hundred and sixty yards in length.</p>

<p>Whenever they are wounded in any encounter, or
bruised by any accident, they apply a sort of yellow root
to the wound, and fast for some time. When their
head achs, they open a vein in that part with a stone
lancet. When they want to glue the points of their arrows
to the shaft, they strike their nose till it bleeds, and
use the blood as glue.</p>

<p>Murder is not punished amongst them, for they have
no judge. With respect to their ceremonies of burying
the dead, they are as follow: The bodies of poor people
are wrapped up in their own clothes, or in mats; then
laid in a grave, and covered over with earth. The bodies
of the rich are put, together with their clothes and arms,
in a small boat made of the wood driven ashore by the
sea: this boat is hung upon poles placed cross-ways; and
the body is thus left to rot in the open air.</p>

<p>The customs and manners of the inhabitants of the
Ale&uuml;tian Isles are nearly similar to those of the inhabitants
of the Fox Islands. The former indeed are
ren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>dered tributary, and entirely subject to Russia; and most
of them have a slight acquaintance with the Russian
language, which they have learned from the crews of the
different vessels who have landed there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First Irruption of the Russians into Siberia
under the Reign of Ivan Vassilievitch I.</div><p>Siberia was
scarcely known to the Russians before the middle of the sixteenth
century<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a
href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. For although
an expedition was made, under the reign of Ivan Vassilievitch
I. into the North Western Parts of that country,
as far as the river Oby, by which several Tartar tribes
were rendered tributary, and some of their chiefs brought
prisoners to Moscow; yet this incursion bore a greater
resemblance to the desultory inroads of barbarians, than
to any permanent establishment of empire by a civilized
nation. Indeed the effects of that expedition soon
va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>nished;
nor does any trace of the least communication
with Siberia again appear in the Russian history before
the reign of Ivan Vassilievitch II. At that period Siberia
again became an object of attention, by means of one
Anika Strogonoff, a Russian merchant, who had established
some salt-works at Solvytshegodskaia, a town in the
government of Archangel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anika Strogonoff trades with the People of
Siberia.</div><p>This person carried on a trade of barter with
the inhabitants of the North-Western parts of Siberia, who
brought every year to the abovementioned town large
quantities of the choicest furs. Upon their return to
their country Strogonoff was accustomed to send with them
some Russian merchants, who crossed the mountains,
and traded with the natives. By these means a considerable
number of very valuable furs were procured at
an easy rate, in exchange for toys and other commodities
of trifling value.</p>

<p>This traffic was continued for several years, without
any interruption; during which Strogonoff rapidly
amassed a very considerable fortune<a name="FNanchor_69_69"
id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69"
class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. At length the
Tzar Ivan Vassilievitch II. foreseeing the advantages
which would accrue to his subjects, from establishing a
more general and regular commerce with these
people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
determined to enlarge the communication already opened
with Siberia. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Second
Irruption of the Russians into Siberia in the Reign of Ivan
Vassilievitch II.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Accordingly he
sent a corps of troops into that country. They followed the same
route which had been discovered by the Russians in the former
expedition, and which was lately frequented by the merchants of
Solvytshegodskaia. It lay along the banks of the Petschora,
and from thence crossed the Yugorian mountains,
which form the North Eastern boundary of Europe.
These troops, however, do not seem to have passed the
Irtish, or to have penetrated further than the Western
branch of the river Oby. Some Tartar tribes were indeed
laid under contribution; and a chief, whose name
was Yediger, consented to pay an annual tribute of a
thousand sables. But this expedition was not productive
of any lasting effects; for soon afterwards Yediger was
defeated, and taken prisoner by Kutchum Chan; the latter
was a lineal descendant of the celebrated Zinghis Chan;
and had newly established his empire in those parts.</p>

<p>This second inroad was probably made about the middle
of the sixteenth century; for the Tzar Ivan Vassilievitch
assumed the title of Lord of all the Siberian lands
so early as 1558, before the conquests made by Yermac
in that kingdom<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. But probably the name of
Siberia was at that time only confined to the district<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
then rendered tributary; and as the Russians extended
their conquests, this appellation was afterwards applied
to the whole tract of country which now bears that
name.</p>

<p>For some time after the above-mentioned expedition,
the Tzar does not appear to have made any attempts towards
recovering his lost authority in those distant regions.
But his attention was again turned to that quarter
by a concurrence of incidents; which, though begun
without his immediate interposition, terminated in a vast
accession of territory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strogonoff forms Settlements upon the Kama
and Tchussovaia.</div><p>Strogonoff, in recompence for having
first opened a trade with the inhabitants of Siberia, obtained from
the Tzar large grants of land; accordingly he founded colonies
upon the banks of the rivers Kama and Tchussovaia;
and these settlements gave rise to the entire subjection of
Siberia by the refuge which they not long afterwards afforded
to Yermac Timofeeff.</p>

<p>This person was nothing more than a fugitive Cossac
of the Don, and chief of a troop of banditti who infested
the shores of the Caspian sea. But as he was the instrument
by which such a vast extent of dominion was added
to the Russian Empire, it will not be uninteresting to
develop the principal circumstances, which brought this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Cossac from the shores of the Caspian to the banks of the
Kama; and to trace the progress which he afterwards
made in the distant regions of Siberia.</p>

<p>By the victories which the Tzar Ivan Vassilievitch had
gained over the Tatars of Casan and Astracan, that monarch
extended his dominions as far as the Caspian Sea;
and thereby established a commerce with the Persians and
Bucharians. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Yermac
is driven from the Shores of the Caspian Sea. A. D. 1577.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> But as the merchants who traded
to those parts were continually pillaged by the Cossacs of the
Don; and as the roads which lay by the side of that
river, and of the Volga, were infested with those banditti;
the Tzar sent a considerable force against them.
Accordingly, they were attacked and routed; part were
slain, part made prisoners, and the rest escaped by flight.
Among the latter was a corps of six thousand Cossacs,
under the command of the above-mentioned Yermac
Timofeeff<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a
href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He retires to Orel, one of the Russian
Settlements.</div><p>That celebrated adventurer, being driven from
his usual haunts, retired, with his followers, into the interior
part of the province of Casan. From thence he directed
his course along the banks of the Kama, until he came
to Orel<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a
href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. That place was one
of the Russian settlements recently planted, and was governed by Maxim
grandson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of Anika Strogonoff. Yermac, instead of storming the
place, and pillaging the inhabitants, acted with a degree
of moderation unusual in a chief of banditti. Being
hospitably received by Strogonoff, and supplied with
every thing that was necessary for the subsistence of his
troops, he fixed his winter quarters at that settlement.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Determines to
invade Siberia.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> His
restless genius however did not suffer him to continue for any
length of time in a state of inactivity; and from the intelligence
he procured concerning the situation of the neighbouring Tartars
of Siberia, he turned his arms toward that quarter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of Siberia.</div><p>Siberia was at
that time partly divided among a number
of separate princes; and partly inhabited by the
various tribes of independent Tartars. Of the former
Kutchum Chan was the most powerful Sovereign. His
dominions consisted of that tract of country which now
forms the South Western part of the province of Tobolsk;
and stretched from the banks of the Irtish and Oby to
those of the Tobol and Tura. His principal residence
was at Sibir<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a
href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>, a small fortress
upon the river Irish, not<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
far from the present town of Tobolsk; and of which
some ruins are still to be seen. Although his power
was very considerable, yet there were some circumstances
which seemed to ensure success to an enterprizing
invader. He had newly acquired a large part of
his territories by conquest; and had, in a great measure,
alienated the affections of his idolatrous subjects by the
intolerant zeal, with which he introduced and disseminated
the Mahometan religion<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.</p>

<p>Strogonoff did not fail of displaying to Yermac this
inviting posture of affairs, as well with a view of removing
him from his present station, as because he himself
was personally exasperated against Kutchum Chan: for
the latter had secretly instigated a large body of Tartars
to invade the Russian settlements upon the river Tchussovaia;
and had afterwards commenced open hostilities
against them with a body of forces under the command
of his cousin Mehemet Kul. And although both these
attempts had failed of success, yet the troops engaged in
them had left behind traces of havock and devastation too
lasting to be easily effaced<a name="FNanchor_75_75"
id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Marches towards Siberia.</div><p>All
these various considerations were not lost upon
Yermac: having therefore employed the winter in preparations
for his intended expedition, he began his
march in the summer of the following year, 1578, along
the banks of the Tchussovaia. The want of proper
guides, and a neglect of other necessary precautions,
greatly retarded his march, and he was overtaken by the
winter before he had made any considerable progress.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Returns to
Orel.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> And at the appearance
of spring he found his stock of provisions so nearly exhausted, that
he was reduced to the necessity of returning to Orel.</p>

<p>But this failure of success by no means extinguished
his ardour for the prosecution of the enterprize; it only
served to make him still more solicitous in guarding
against the possibility of a future miscarriage. By threats
he extorted from Strogonoff every assistance which the
nature of the expedition seemed to require. Besides a
sufficient quantity of provisions, all his followers, who
were before unprovided with fire-arms, were supplied
with muskets and ammunition; and, in order to give
the appearance of a regular army to his troops, colours
were distributed to each company, which were ornamented
with the images of saints, after the manner of
the Russians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>Having thus made all previous arrangements, he
thought himself in a condition to force his way into
Siberia. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>His second
Expedition.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Accordingly, in the
month of June, 1579, he set out upon this second expedition. His
followers amounted to five thousand men; adventurers inured to
hardships, and regardless of danger: they placed implicit
confidence in their leader, and seemed to be all
animated with one and the same spirit. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Arrives upon the Banks of the
Tura.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> He continued
his route partly by land, and partly by water: the
navigation however of the rivers was so tedious, and
the roads so rugged and difficult, that eighteen months
elapsed before he reached Tchingi, a small town upon
the banks of the Tura<a name="FNanchor_76_76"
id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<p>Here he mustered his troops, and found his army considerably
reduced: part had been exhausted by fatigue,
part carried off by sickness, and part cut off in skirmishes
with the Tartars. The whole remaining number
amounted to about fifteen hundred effective men;
and yet with this handful of troops Yermac did not
hesitate a moment in advancing against Kutchum Chan.
That prince was already in a posture of defence; and
resolved to guard his crown to the last extremity. Having
collected his forces, he dispatched several flying
parties against Yermac, himself remaining behind with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the slower of his troops: but all these detachments were
driven back with considerable loss; and worried in many
successive skirmishes. Yermac continued his march
without intermission, bearing down all resistance until
he reached the center of his adversary's dominions.</p>

<p>These successes however were dearly bought; for his
army was now reduced to five hundred men. Kutchum
Chan was encamped<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> at no great distance upon the
banks of the Irtish, with a very superior force, and determined
to give him battle. Yermac, who was not to
be daunted by the inequality of numbers, prepared for
the engagement with a confidence which never forsook
him; his troops were equally impatient for action, and
knew no medium between conquest and death. The
event of the combat corresponded with this magnanimity.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Defeats Ketchum Chan.
1581.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> After
an obstinate and well fought battle, victory declared
in favour of Yermac: the Tartars were entirely routed,
and the carnage was so general, that Kutchum Chan
himself escaped with difficulty.</p>

<p>This defeat proved decisive: Kutchum Chan was deserted
by his subjects; and Yermac, who knew how to
improve as well as gain a victory, marched
without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
delay to Sibir, the residence of the Tartar princes. He
was well aware, that the only method to secure his conquest
was to get possession of that important fortress.
He expected therefore to have found in that place a
considerable garrison, determined to sacrifice their lives
in its defence. But the news of the late defeat had
diffused universal consternation, and Sibir was entirely
deserted. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Seats
himself upon the Throne.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
A body of troops whom he sent before him,
to reduce the fortress, found it quite deserted: he himself
soon after made his triumphant entry, and seated
himself upon the throne without the least opposition.
Here he fixed his residence, and received the allegiance
of the neighbouring people, who poured in from
all quarters upon the news of this unexpected revolution.
The Tartars were so struck with his gallant intrepidity
and brilliant exploits, that they submitted to
his authority without hesitation, and acquiesced in the
payment of the usual tribute.</p>

<p>Thus this enterprising Cossac was suddenly exalted
from the station of a chief of banditti to the rank of
a sovereign prince. It does not appear from history
whether it were at first his design to conquer Siberia,
or solely to amass a considerable booty. The latter
indeed seems the more probable conjecture. The rapid
tide of success with which he was carried on,
and the entire defeat of Kutchum Chan, afterwards
expanded his views, and opened a larger scene to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
ambition. But whatever were his original projects,
he seems worthy, so far as intrepidity and prudence
form a basis of merit, of the final success which
flowed in upon him. For he was neither elated with
unexpected prosperity, nor dazzled with the sudden
glare of royalty: on the contrary, the dignity of his
deportment was as consistent and unaffected, as if he
had been born a sovereign.</p>

<p>And now Yermac and his followers seemed to enjoy
those rewards which they had dearly purchased by a
course of unremitted fatigue, and by victories which
almost exceeded belief. Not only the tribes in the
neigbourhood of Sibir wore the appearance of the most
unreserved submission; but even princes continued
flocking in from distant parts, to acknowledge themselves
tributary, and to claim his protection. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Precarious Situation of Yermac.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> However,
this calm was of short duration. Insurrections were
concerted by Kutchum Chan; who, though driven from
his dominions, yet still retained no small degree of
influence over his former subjects.</p>

<p>Yermac saw and felt the precariousness of his present
grandeur; the inconsiderable number of his followers
who had survived the conquest of Sibir, had been still
further diminished by an ambuscade of the enemy;
and as he could not depend on the affection of his
new subjects, he found himself under the necessity
either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of calling in foreign assistance, or of relinquishing his
dominion. Under these circumstances he had recourse
to the Tzar of Muscovy; and made a tender of his new
acquisitions to that monarch, upon condition of receiving
immediate and effectual support. The judicious manner
in which he conducted this measure, shews him no less
able in the arts of negotiation than of war.</p>

<p>One of his most confidential followers was dispatched
to Moscow at the head of fifty Cossacs. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Cedes his Conquests to the Tzar of
Muscovy.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> He had
orders to represent to the court the progress which
the Russian troops, under the command of Yermac, had
made in Siberia: he was artfully to add, that an extensive
empire was conquered in the name of the Tzar; that
the natives were reduced to swear allegiance to that
monarch, and consented to pay an annual tribute.
This representation was accompanied with a present of
the choicest and most valuable furs<a name="FNanchor_78_78"
id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>1582.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> The embassador
was received at Moscow with the strongest marks of satisfaction:
a public thanksgiving was celebrated in the cathedral;
the Tzar acknowledged and extolled the good
services of Yermac; he granted him a pardon for all
former offences; and, as a testimony of his favour, distributed
presents for him and his followers. Amongst
those which were sent to Yermac was a fur robe, which
the Tzar himself had worn, and which was the
greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
mark of distinction that could be conferred upon a subject.
To these was added a sum of money, and a promise of
speedy and effectual assistance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Yermac, notwithstanding the inferior number
of his troops, did not remain inactive within the
fortress of Sibir. He defeated all attempts of Kutchum
Chan to recover his crown; and took his principal general
prisoner. He made occasional inroads into the adjacent
provinces, and extended his conquests up to the
source of the river Taffda on one side, and on the other
as far as the district which lies upon the river Oby above
its junction with the Irtish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Receives a Reinforcement of Russian
troops.</div><p>At length the promised succours arrived at Sibir. They
consisted of five hundred Russians, under the command
of prince Bolkosky, who was appointed wayvode or governor
of Siberia. Strengthened by this reinforcement,
Yermac continued his excursions on all sides with his
usual activity; and gained several bloody victories over
different princes, who were imprudent enough to assert
their independence.</p>

<p>In one of these expeditions he laid siege to Kullara,
a small fortress upon the banks of the Irtish, which still
belonged to Kutchum Chan: but he found it so bravely
defended by that monarch, that all his efforts to carry it
by storm proved ineffectual. Upon his return to Sibir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
he was followed at some distance by that prince, who
hung unperceived upon his rear; and was prepared to
seize any fortunate moment of attack which might occur;
nor was it long before a favourable opportunity presented
itself. The Russians to the number of about three hundred
lay negligently posted in a small island, formed by
two branches of the Irtish. The night was obscure and
rainy; and the troops, who were fatigued with a long
march, reposed themselves without suspicion of danger.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Surprised by Kutchum
Chan.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Kutchum
Chan, apprised of their situation, silently advanced
at midnight with a select body of troops; and having forded
the river, came with such rapidity upon the Russians, as to
preclude the use of their arms. In the darkness and
confusion of the night, the latter were cut to pieces
almost without opposition; and fell a resistless prey to
those adversaries, whom they had been accustomed to conquer
and despise. The massacre was so universal, that
only one man is recorded to have escaped, and to have
brought the news of this catastrophe to his countrymen
at Sibir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Yermac.</div><p>Yermac himself
perished in the rout, though he did
not fall by the sword of the enemy. In all the hurry
of surprise, he was not so much infected with the general
panic, as to forget his usual intrepidity, which seemed
to be encreased rather than abated by the danger of his
present situation. After many desperate acts of
heroism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
he cut his way through the troops who surrounded
him, and made to the banks of the Irtish<a name="FNanchor_79_79"
id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. Being
closely pursued by a detachment of the enemy, he endeavoured
to throw himself into a boat which lay near
the shore; but stepping short, he fell into the water,
and being incumbered with the weight of his armour,
sunk instantly to the bottom<a name="FNanchor_80_80"
id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.</p>

<p>His body was not long afterwards taken out of the
Irtish, and exposed, by order of Kutchum Chan, to all
the insults which revenge ever suggested to barbarians
in the frenzy of success. But these first transports of
resentment had no sooner subsided, than the Tartars
testified the most pointed indignation at the ungenerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
ferocity of their leader. The prowess of Yermac, his
consummate valour and magnanimity, virtues which
barbarians know how to prize, rose upon their recollection.
They made a sudden transition from one extreme
to the other: they reproached their leader for
ordering, themselves for being the instruments of indignity
to such venerable remains. At length their heated
imaginations proceeded even to consecrate his memory:
they interred his body with all the rites of Pagan superstition;
and offered up sacrifices to his manes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Veneration paid to his Memory.</div><p>Many
miraculous stories were soon spread abroad, and
met with implicit belief. The touch of his body was
supposed to have been an instantaneous cure for all disorders;
and even his clothes and arms were said to be
endowed with the same efficacy. A flame of fire was
represented as sometimes hovering about his tomb, and
sometimes as stretching in one luminous body from the
same spot towards the heavens. A presiding influence
over the affairs of the chace and of war was attributed
to his departed spirit; and numbers resorted to his tomb
to invoke his tutelary aid in concerns so interesting to
uncivilised nations. These idle fables, though they
evince the superstitious credulity of the Tartars, convey
at the same time the strongest testimony of their veneration
for the memory of Yermac; and this veneration<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
greatly contributed to the subsequent progress of the
Russians in those regions<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p>With Yermac expired for a time the Russian empire
in Siberia. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The
Russians quit Siberia.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The news of his defeat and death no sooner
reached the garrison of Sibir, than an hundred and fifty
troops, the sad remains of that formidable army which
had gained such a series of almost incredible victories,
retired from the fortress, and evacuated Siberia. Notwithstanding
this disaster, the court of Moscow did not
abandon its design upon that country; which a variety
of favourable circumstances still concurred to render a
flattering object of Russian ambition. Yermac's sagacity
had discovered new and commodious routes for the
march of troops across those inhospitable regions. The
rapidity with which he had overrun the territories of
Kutchum Chan, taught the Russians to consider the
Tartars as an easy prey. Many of the tribes who had
been rendered tributary by Yermac, had testified a cheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>ful
acquiescence under the sovereignty of the Tzar; and
were inclined to renew their allegiance upon the first
opportunity. Others looked upon all resistance as unavailing,
and had learned, from dear-bought experience,
to tremble at the very name of a Russian. The natural
strength of the country, proved not to be irresistible
when united, was considerably weakened by its intestine
commotions. Upon the retreat of the garrison of Sibir,
that fortress, together with the adjacent district, was
seized by Seyidyak, son of the former sovereign, whom
Kutchum Chan had dethroned and put to death. Other
princes availed themselves of the general confusion to
assert independency; and Kutchum Chan was able to
regain only a small portion of those dominions, of which
he had been stripped by Yermac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Russians re-enter
Siberia.</div><p>Influenced by these motives, the court of Moscow
sent a body of three hundred troops into Siberia,
who penetrated to the banks of the Tura as far as
Tschingi almost without opposition. There they built
the fort of Tumen, and re-established their authority
over the neighbouring district. Being soon afterwards
reinforced by an additional number of troops, they were
enabled to extend their operations, and to erect the fortresses
of Tobolsk, Sungur, and Tara. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Re-conquer their antient Territories.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> The erection of
these and other fortresses was soon attended with
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
speedy recovery of the whole territory, which Yermac
had reduced under the Russian yoke.</p>

<p>This success was only the fore-runner of still greater
acquisitions. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>All
Siberia conquered and colonized.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Russians pushed their conquest far
and wide: wherever they appeared, the Tartars were
either reduced or exterminated. New towns were built
and colonies were planted on all sides. Before a century
had well elapsed, all that vast tract of country now called
Siberia, which stretches from the confines of Europe to
the Eastern Ocean, and from the Frozen Sea to the present
frontiers of China, was annexed to the Russian dominions.</p>

China had not suddenly interposed.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the seventeenth century, the Russians were
rapidly extending themselves Eastward through that important
territory, which lies, on each side of the river<a
name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Amoor. They soon reduced
several independent Tungusian hordes; and built a chain
of small fortresses along the banks of the above-mentioned
river, of which the principal were Albasin, and Kamarskoi Ostrog. Not
long afterwards, the Chinese under<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a
href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Camhi conceived a similar design of
subduing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the same hordes. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Rise
of animosities between the Russians and Chinese.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> Accordingly the two great
powers of Russia and China, thus pointing their views to the same
object, unavoidably clashed; and, after several jealousies
and intrigues, broke out into open hostilities about the
year 1680. The Chinese laid siege to Kamarskoi Ostrog,
and though repulsed in this attempt, found means to cut
off several straggling parties of Russians. These animosities
induced the Tzar Alex&egrave;y Michaelovitch to send an
embassy to Pekin; but this measure did not produce the
desired effect. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Albasin
destroyed by the Chinese.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Chinese attacked Albasin with a considerable
force: having compelled the Russian garrison
to capitulate, they demolished that and all the Russian
forts upon the Amoor; and returned, with a large number
of prisoners, to their own country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Albasin rebuilt by the Russians, is besieged
by the Chinese.</div><p>Not long after their departure, a body of
sixteen hundred Russians advanced along the Amoor; and constructed
a new fort, under the old name of Albasin. The Chinese
were no sooner apprised of their return, than
they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
marched instantly towards that river, and sat down before
Albasin with an army of seven thousand men, and
a large train of artillery. They battered the new fortress
for several weeks, without being able to make a
breach, and without attempting to take it by storm. The
besieged, though not much annoyed by the unskilful
operations of the enemy, were exhausted with the complicated
miseries of sickness and famine; and notwithstanding
they continued to make a gallant resistance,
they must soon have sunk under their distresses, if the
Chinese had not voluntarily retired, in consequence of a
treaty being set afoot between the two courts of Moscow
and Pekin. For this purpose the Russian embassador
Golowin had left Moscow so early as the year 1685, accompanied
by a large body of troops, in order to secure
his person, and enforce respect to his embassy. The
difficulty of procuring subsistence for any considerable
number of men in those desolate regions, joined to the
ruggedness of the roads, and the length of the march,
prevented his arrival at Selengisk until the year 1687.
From thence messengers were immediately dispatched
with overtures of peace to the Chinese government at
Pekin.</p>

<p>After several delays, occasioned partly by policy, and
partly by the posture of affairs in the Tartar country
through which the Chinese were to pass,
embassadors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
left Pekin in the beginning of June 1689. Golovin
had proposed receiving them at Albasin; but while he
was proceeding to that fortress, the Chinese embassadors
presented themselves at the gates of Nershinsk, escorted
by such a numerous army, and such a formidable train
of artillery, that Golovin was constrained, from motives
of fear, to conclude the negotiation almost upon their
own terms.</p>

<p>The conferences were held under tents, in an open
plain, near the town of Nershinsk; where the treaty
was signed and sealed by the plenipotentaries of the two
courts. When it was proposed to ratify it by oath, the
Chinese embassadors offered to swear upon a crucifix;
but Golovin preferred their taking an oath in the name
of their own gods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treaty of Nershinsk.</div><p>This treaty
first checked the progress of the Russian
arms in those parts; and laid the foundations of an important
and regular commerce between the two nations.</p>

<p>By the first and second articles, the South-Eastern
boundaries of the Russian empire were formed by a
ridge of mountains, stretching North of the Amoor
from the sea of Ochotsk to the source of the small
river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Gorbitza<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a
href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>, then by that river
to its influx into the Amoor, and lastly by the Argoon, from its
junction with the Shilka up to its source.</p>

<p>By the fifth article reciprocal liberty of trade was
granted to all the subjects of the two empires, who were
provided with pass-ports from their respective courts<a
name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p>This treaty was signed on the 27th of August, in the
year 1689, under the reign of Ivan and Peter Alexiewitch,
by which the Russians lost, exclusively of a large
territory, the navigation of the river Amoor. The importance
of this loss was not at that time understood;
and has only been felt since the discovery of Kamtchatka,
and of the islands between Asia and America. The products
of these new-discovered countries might, by means
of the Amoor, have been conveyed by water into the
district of Nershinsk, from whence there is an
easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
transport by land to Kiachta: whereas the same merchandise,
after being landed at Ochotsk, is now carried
over a large tract of country, partly upon rivers of difficult
navigation, and partly along rugged and almost impassable
roads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of the Commerce with China.</div><p>In
return, the Russians obtained what they long and
repeatedly aimed at, a regular and permanent trade with
the Chinese. The first intercourse between Russia and
China commenced in the beginning of the seventeenth
century<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a
href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. At that period a
small quantity of Chinese merchandise was procured, by the merchants
of Tomsk and other adjacent towns, from the Calmucs. The rapid
and profitable sale of these commodities encouraged
certain Wayvodes of Siberia to attempt a direct and open
communication with China. For this purpose several
deputations were sent at different times to Pekin from
Tobolsk, Tomsk, and other Russian settlements: these
deputations, although they failed of obtaining the grant
of a regular commerce, were nevertheless attended with
some important consequences. The general good reception,
which the agents met with, tempted the Russian
merchants to send occasional traders to Pekin. By
these means a faint connection with that metropolis was
kept alive: the Chinese learned the advantages of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Russian trade, and were gradually prepared for its subsequent
establishment. This commerce, carried on by
intervals, was entirely suspended by the hostilities upon
the river Amoor. But no sooner was the treaty of Nershinsk
signed, than the Russians engaged with extraordinary
alacrity in this favourite branch of traffic. The
advantages of this trade were soon found to be so considerable,
that Peter I. conceived an idea of still farther
enlarging it. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Caravans
allowed to trade to Pekin.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Accordingly, in 1692, he sent Isbrand
Ives, a Dutchman in his service, to Pekin, who requested
and obtained, that the liberty of trading to China, which
by the late treaty was granted to individuals, should be
extended to caravans.</p>

<p>In consequence of this arrangement, successive caravans
went from Russia to Pekin, where a caravansary
was allotted for their reception; and all their expences
during their continuance in that metropolis defrayed by
the Emperor of China. The right of sending these caravans,
and the profits resulting from them, belonged to
the crown of Russia. In the mean time, private merchants
continued as before to carry on a separate trade
with the Chinese, not only at Pekin, but also at the head
quarters of the Mongols. The camp of these roving
Tartars was generally to be found near the conflux of the
Orchon and Tola, between the Southern frontiers of
Siberia and the Mongol desert. A kind of annual
fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
was held at this spot by the Russian and Chinese merchants;
where they brought their respective goods for
sale; and continued until they were disposed of. This
rendezvous soon became a scene of riot and confusion;
and repeated complaints were transmitted to the Chinese
Emperor of the drunkenness and misconduct of the Russians.
These complaints made a still greater impression
from a coincidence of similar excesses, for which the Russians
at Pekin had become notorious.</p>

<p>Exasperated by the frequent representations of his
subjects, Camhi threatened to expell the Russians from
his dominions, and to prohibit them from carrying on
any commerce, as well in China as in the country of the
Mongols.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Embassy of Ismailoff to Pekin.</div><p>These
untoward circumstances occasioned another
embassy to Pekin, in the year 1719. Leff Vassilievitch
Ismailoff, a captain of the Russian guards, who was sent
embassador upon this occasion, succeeded in the negotiation,
and adjusted every difficulty to the satisfaction
of both parties. At his departure he was permitted to
leave behind Laurence Lange, who had accompanied him
to Pekin, in the character of agent for the caravans; for
the purpose of superintending the conduct of the Russians.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Russians expelled from
Pekin.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> His residence however in
that metropolis was but short; for he was soon afterwards compelled,
by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Chinese, to return. His dismission was owing, partly,
to a sudden caprice of that suspicious people, and partly
to a misunderstanding, which had recently broke out
between the two courts, in relation to some Mongol tribes
who bordered upon Siberia. A small number of these
Mongols had put themselves under the protection of
Russia, and were immediately demanded by the Chinese;
but the Russians refused compliance, under pretence that
no article in the treaty of Nershinsk could, with any appearance
of probability, be construed as extending to the
Mongols. The Chinese were incensed at this refusal;
and their resentment was still further inflamed by the
disorderly conduct of the Russian traders, who, freed
from all controul by the departure of their agent, had
indulged, without restraint, their usual propensity to
excess. This concurrence of unlucky incidents extorted,
in 1722, an order from Camhi for the total expulsion of
the Russians from the Chinese and Mongol territories.
These orders were regorously executed; and all intercourse
between the two nations immediately ceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Embassy of Ragusinski.</div><p>Affairs
continued in this state until the year 1727,
when the count Sava Vladislavitch Ragusinski, a Dalmatian
in the service of Russia, was dispatched to Pekin.
His orders were at all events to compose the differences
between the two courts relating to the Mongol tribes;
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
settle the Southern frontiers of the Russian empire in
that quarter; and to obtain the permission of renewing
the trade with China. Accordingly that embassador
presented a new plan for a treaty of limits and commerce
to Yundschin, son and successor of Camhi; by
which the frontiers of the two empires were finally
traced as they exist at present, and the commerce established
upon a permanent basis, calculated to prevent
as far as possible all future sources of misunderstanding.
This plan being approved by the emperor, Chinese
commissioners were immediately appointed to negotiate
with the Russian embassador upon the banks
of the Bura, a small river which flows, South of the
confines of Siberia, into the Orchon near its junction
with the Selenga.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treaty of Kiatchta.</div><p>At this
conference, the old limits, which are mentioned
in the treaty of Nershinsk, were continued from the
source of the Argoon Westwards as far as the mountain
Sabyntaban, which is situated at a small distance from
the spot where the conflux of the two rivers Uleken and
Kemtzak form the Yenis&egrave;i: this boundary separates the
Russian dominions from the territory of the Mongols,
who are under the protection of China.</p>

<p>It was likewise stipulated, that for the future all negotiations
should be transacted between the tribunal
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
foreign affairs at Pekin, and the board of foreign affairs
at St. Petersburg; or in matters of inferior moment
between the commanders of the frontiers<a name="FNanchor_87_87"
id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>The most important articles relating to commerce,
were as follow:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Account of the Treaty relative to
Commerce.</div><p>A caravan was allowed to go to Pekin every three
years, on condition of its not consisting of more than
two hundred persons; during their residence in that
metropolis, their expences were no longer to be defrayed
by the emperor of China. Notice was to be sent to the
Chinese court immediately upon their arrival at the
frontiers; where an officer was to meet and accompany
them to Pekin.</p>

<p>The privilege before enjoyed by individuals of carrying
on a promiscuous traffic in the Chinese and Mongol
territories was taken away, and no merchandize belonging
to private persons was permitted to be brought for
sale beyond the frontiers. For the purpose of preserving,
consistently with this regulation, the privilege
of commerce to individuals, two places of resort
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
appointed on the confines of Siberia: one called Kiatchta,
from a rivulet of that name near which it
stands; and the other Zuruchaitu: at these places a
free trade was reciprocally indulged to the subjects of
the two nations.</p>

<p>A permission was at the same time obtained for
building a Russian church within the precincts of their
caravansary; and for the celebration of divine service,
four priests were allowed to reside at Pekin<a name="FNanchor_88_88"
id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. The
same favour was also extended to some Russian Scholars<a
name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
for the purpose of learning the Chinese tongue; in order
to qualify themselves for interpreters between the two nations.</p>

<p>This treaty, called the treaty of Kiachta, was, on the
fourteenth of June, 1728, concluded and ratified by the
count Ragusinski and three Chinese plenipotentaries upon
the spot, where Kiachta was afterwards built: it is the
basis of all transactions since carried on between Russia
and China<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a
href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p>One innovation in the mode of carrying on the trade
to China, which has been introduced since the accession
of the present empress Catherine II. deserves to be mentioned
in this place. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Caravans
discontinued.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Since
the year 1755 no caravans have been sent to Pekin. Their first
discontinuance was owing to a misunderstanding between the two
courts of Petersburg and Pekin in 1759. Their disuse after
the reconciliation had taken place, arose from the following
circumstances. The exportation and importation
of many principal commodities, particularly the most
valuable furs, were formerly prohibited to individuals,
and solely appropriated to caravans belonging to the
crown. By these restrictions the Russian trade to China
was greatly shackled and circumscribed. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Monopoly of the Fur Trade abolished.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> The present<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
empress (who, amidst many excellent regulations which
characterise her reign, has shewn herself invariably attentive
to the improvement of the Russian commerce)
abolished, in 1762, the monopoly of the fur trade, and
renounced in favour of her subjects the exclusive privilege
which the crown enjoyed of sending caravans to
Pekin<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a
href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. By these
concessions the profits of the trade
have been considerably encreased: the great expence,
hazard, and delay, of transporting the merchandise occasionally
from the frontiers of Siberia to Pekin, has been
retrenched; and Kiachta is now rendered the center
of the Russian and Chinese commerce.</p>

<p>By the last mentioned treaty it was stipulated, that
the commerce between Russia and China should be
transacted at the frontiers. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Russian and Chinese Settlement upon the
Brook Kiachta.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Accordingly two
spots were marked out for that purpose upon the confines of Siberia,
where they border upon the Mongol desert; one near
the brook Kiachta, and the other at Zuruchaitu. The
description of the former of these places forms the subject
of this chapter.</p>

<p>This settlement consists of a Russian and Chinese
town, both situated in a romantic valley, surrounded
by high, rocky, and for the most part well-wooded, mountains.
This valley is intersected by the brook Kiachta,
which rises in Siberia, and, after washing both the Russian
and Chinese town, falls into the Bura, at a small distance
from the frontiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Situation of the Russian Frontier Town
Kiachta.</div><p>The Russian settlement is called Kiachta from the
abovementioned brook: it lies in 124 degrees 18
mi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>nutes
longitude from the isle of Fero, and 35 degrees
N. latitude, at the distance of 5514 versts from Moscow,
and 1532 from Pekin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fortress.</div><p>It consists of a
fortress and a small suburb. The
fortress, which is built upon a gentle rise, is a square
enclosed with palisadoes, and strengthened with wooden
bastions at the several angles. There are three gates,
at which guards are constantly stationed: one of the
gates faces the North, a second the South towards the
Chinese frontiers, and a third the East close to the brook
Kiachta. The principal public buildings in the fortress
are a wooden church, the governor's house, the custom
house, the magazine for provisions, and the guard-house.
It contains also a range of shops and warehouses, barracks
for the garrison, and several houses belonging to
the crown; the latter are generally inhabited by the
principal merchants. These buildings are mostly of
wood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suburb.</div><p>The suburb, which is
surrounded with a wooden wall
covered at the top with chevaux de frize, contains no
more than an hundred and twenty houses very irregularly
built; it has the same number of gates as the
fortress, which are also guarded. Without this suburb,
upon the high road leading to Selenginsk, stand a few
houses, and the magazine for rhubarb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>This settlement is but indifferently provided with
water both in quality and quantity; for although the
brook Kiachta is dammed up as it flows by the fortress,
yet it is so shallow in summer, that, unless after heavy
rains, it is scarcely sufficient to supply the inhabitants.
Its stream is troubled and unwholesome, and the springs
which rise in the neighbourhood are either foul or
brackish: from these circumstances, the principal inhabitants
are obliged to send for water from a spring in
the Chinese district. The soil of the adjacent country
is mostly sand or rock, and extremely barren. If the
frontiers of Russia were extended about nine versts more
South to the rivulet of Bura; the inhabitants of Kiachta
would then enjoy good water, a fruitful soil, and plenty
of fish, all which advantages are at present confined to
the Chinese.</p>

<p>The garrison of Kiachta consists of a company of
regular soldiers, and a certain number of Cossacs; the
former are occasionally changed, but the latter are fixed
inhabitants of the place. It is the province of the
commander to inspect the frontiers, and, in conjunction
with the president of the Chinese merchants, to settle
all affairs of an inferior nature; but in matters of importance
recourse must be had to the chancery of Selenginsk,
and to the governor of Irkutsk. The
Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
merchants, and the agents of the Russian trading company,
are the principal inhabitants of Kiachta.</p>

<p>The limits Westwards from this settlement to the
river Selenga, and Eastwards as far as Tchikoi, are
bounded with chevaux de frize, placed there to prevent
a contraband trade in cattle, for the exportation of
which a considerable duty is paid to the crown. All
the outposts along the frontiers Westwards as far as the
government of Tobolsk, and Eastwards to the mountains
of snow, are under the command of the governor of
Kiachta.</p>

<p>The most elevated of the mountains that surround
the valley of Kiachta, and which is called by the Mongols
Burgultei, commands the Russian as well as the
Chinese town; for this reason, the Chinese, at the conclusion
of the last frontier treaty, demanded the cession
of this mountain under the pretext, that some of their
deified ancestors were buried upon its summit. The
Russians gave way to their request, and suffered the
boundary to be brought back to the North side of the
mountain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maimatschin, the Chinese
Frontier-Town.</div><p>The Chinese town is called, by the Chinese
and Mongols, Maimatschin, which signifies fortress of commerce.
The Russians term it the Chinese Village
(Kitaiskaia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Sloboda) and also Naimatschin, which is a corruption of
Maimatschin. It is situated about an hundred and forty
yards South of the fortress of Kiachta, and nearly parallel
to it. Midway between this place and the Russian
fortress, two posts about ten feet high are planted in
order to mark the frontiers of the two empires: one is
inscribed with Russian, the other with Manshur
characters<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a
href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>Mainatschin has no other fortification than a wooden
wall, and a small ditch of about three feet broad; the
latter was dug in the year 1756, during the war between
the Chinese and the Calmucs. The town is of
an oblong form: its length is seven hundred yards,
and its breadth four hundred. On each of the four
sides a large gate faces the principal streets; over each
of these gates there is a wooden guard-house for the
Chinese garrison, which consists of Mongols in tattered
clothes, and armed with clubs. Without the gate, which
looks to the Russian frontiers, and about the distance of
eight yards from the entrance, the Chinese have raised
a wooden screen, so constructed as to intercept all view
of the streets from without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>This town contains two hundred houses and about
twelve hundred inhabitants. It has two principal streets
of about eight yards broad, crossing each other in the
middle at right angles, with two by-streets running from
North to South. They are not paved, but are laid with
gravel, and kept remarkably clean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Houses.</div><p>The houses are spacious,
uniformly built of wood, of
only one story, not more than fourteen feet high, plaistered
and white-washed; they are constructed round a
court yard of about seventy feet square, which is strewed
with gravel, and has an appearance of neatness. Each
house consists of a sitting room, some warehouses
and a kitchen. In the houses of the wealthier sort
the roof is made of plank; but in meaner habitations
of lath covered over with turf. Towards the
streets most of the houses have arcades of wood projecting
forwards from the roof like a penthouse, and
supported by strong pillars. The windows are large
after the European manner, but on account of the dearness
of glass and Russian talk are generally of paper,
excepting a few panes of glass in the sitting room.</p>

<p>The sitting room looks seldom towards the streets:
it is a kind of shop, where the several patterns of
merchandize are placed in recesses, fitted up with
shelves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
and secured with paper doors for the purpose of keeping
out the dust. The windows are generally ornamented
with little paintings, and the walls are hung with
Chinese paper. Half the floor is of hard beaten
clay; the other half is covered with boards, and rises
about two feet in height. Here the family sit
in the day-time and sleep at night. By the side of this
raised part, and nearly upon the same level, there is a
square brick stove, with a streight perpendicular cylindrical
excavation, which is heated with small pieces of
wood. From the bottom of this stove a tube descends,
and is carried zigzag under the boarded floor above-mentioned,
and from thence to a chimney which opens
into the street. By this contrivance, although the stove
is always open and the flame visible, yet the room is
never troubled in the least degree with smoke. There is
scarcely any furniture in the room, excepting one large
dining table in the lower part, and two small lackered
ones upon the raised floor: one of these tables
is always provided with a chaffing dish, which serves
to light their pipes when the stove is not heated.</p>

<p>In this room there are several small niches covered
with silken curtains, before which are placed lamps
that are lighted upon festivals; these niches contain
painted paper idols, a stone or metal vessel, wherein
the ashes of incense are collected, several small
orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>ments
and artificial flowers: the Chinese readily allow
strangers to draw aside the curtains, and look at the idols.</p>

<p>The Bucharian<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a
href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> merchants inhabit
the South West quarter of Maimatschin. Their houses are not so
large nor commodious as those of the Chinese, although the
greatest part of them carry on a very considerable commerce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Governor of Maimatschin.</div><p>The
Surgutsch&egrave;i, or governor of Maimatschin, has the
care of the police, as well as the direction of all affairs
relating to commerce: he is generally a person of
rank, oftentimes a Mandarin, who has misbehaved
himself in another station, and is sent here as a kind
of punishment. He is distinguished from the rest by
the crystal button of his cap, and by a
peacock's<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a
href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> fea<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>ther
hanging behind. The Chinese give him the
title of Amban, which signifies commander in chief;
and no one appears before him without bending the
knee, in which posture the person who brings a petition
must remain until he receives the governor's answer.
His salary is not large; but the presents which he receives
from the merchants amount annually to a considerable sum.</p>

<p>The most remarkable public buildings in Maimatschin,
are the governor's house, the theatre, and two
pagodas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">House of the Governor.</div><p>The
governor's house is larger than the others, and
better furnished; it is distinguished by a chamber where
the court of justice is held, and by two high poles before
the entrance ornamented with flags.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theatre.</div><p>The theatre is situated close to
the wall of the town near the great pagoda: it is a kind of small
shed, neatly painted, open in front, and merely spacious enough to
contain the stage; the audience stand in the street.
Near it are two high poles, upon which large flags with
Chinese inscriptions are hoisted on festivals. On such
occasions the servants belonging to the merchants play
short burlesque farces in honour of their idols.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The small Pagoda.</div><p>The smallest of
the two Pagodas is a wooden building,
standing upon pillars, in the centre of the town at the
place where the two principal streets cross. It is a Chinese
tower of two stories, adorned on the outside with
small columns, paintings, and little iron bells, &amp;c.
The first story is square, the second octangular.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Idol Tien.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> In the
lower story is a picture representing the God Tien, which
signifies, according to the explanation of the most intelligent
Chinese, the most high God, who rules over the
thirty-two heavens. The Manshurs, it is said, call this
idol Abcho; and the Mongols, Tingheru heaven, or the
God of heaven. He is represented sitting with his head
uncovered, and encircled with a ray<a name="FNanchor_95_95"
id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> of glory similar to
that which surrounds the head of our Saviour in the Roman
catholic paintings; his hair is long and flowing;
he holds in his right hand a drawn sword, and his left
is extended as in the act of giving a benediction. On one
side of this figure two youths, on the other a maiden
and a grey-headed old man, are delineated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The upper story contains the picture of another idol in
a black and white checquered cap, with the same figures
of three young persons and a little old man. There are
no altars in this temple, and no other ornaments excepting
these pictures and their frames. It is opened only on
festivals, and strangers cannot see it without permission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The great Pagoda and its Idols.</div><p>The
great Pagoda<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a
href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, situated before
the governor's house, and near the principal gate looking to the
south, is larger and more magnificent than the former.
Strangers are allowed to see it at all times, without the
least difficulty, provided they are accompanied by one of
the priests, who are always to be found in the area of
the temple. This area is surrounded with chevaux de
frize: the entrance is from the south through two gates
with a small building between them. In the inside of
this building are two recesses with rails before them, behind
which the images of two horses as big as life are
coarsly moulded out of clay; they are saddled and bridled,
and attended by two human figures dressed like grooms:
the horse to the right is of a chesnut colour, the other
is dun with a black mane and tail, the former is in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
attitude of springing, the latter of walking. Near each horse a
banner of yellow silk, painted with silver dragons, is displayed.</p>

<p>In the middle of this area are two wooden turrets surrounded
with galleries; a large bell of cart iron which is
struck occasionally with a large wooden mallet, hangs in
the Eastern turret; the other contains two kettle drums
of an enormous size, similar to those made use of in the
religious ceremonies of the Calmucs. On each side of
this area are ranges of buildings inhabited by the priest
of the temple.</p>

<p>This area communicates by means of an handsome
gateway with the inner court, which is bordered on each
side by small compartments open in front, with rails before
them; in the inside of these compartments the
legendary stories of the idols are exhibited in a series
of historical paintings. At the farther extremity
of this court stands a large building, constructed in the
same style of architecture as the temple. The inside is
sixty feet long and thirty broad: it is stored with antient
weapons, and instruments of war of a prodigious size;
such as spears, scythes, and long pikes, with broad
blades, shields, coats of arms, and military ensigns representing
hands<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a
href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>, dragons heads,
and other carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
figures. All these warlike instruments are richly gilded,
and ranged in order upon scaffolds along the wall. Opposite
the entrance a large yellow standard, embroidered
with foliage and silver dragons, is erected; under it, upon
a kind of altar, there is a series of little oblong tables,
bearing Chinese inscriptions.</p>

<p>An open gallery, adorned on both sides with flower-pots,
leads from the back door of the armoury to the colonade
of the temple. In this colonade two slate tablets
are placed, in wooden frames, about six feet high and
two broad, with long inscriptions relating to the building
of the temple. Before one of these plates a small idol of
an hideous form stands upon the ground, enclosed in a
wooden case.</p>

<p>The temple itself is an elegant Chinese building,
richly decorated on the outside with columns lackered,
and gilded carved-work, small bells, and other ornaments
peculiar to the Chinese architecture. Within there
is a rich profusion of gilding, which corresponds with
the gaudiness of the exterior. The walls are covered
thick with paintings, exhibiting the most celebrated exploits
of the principal idol.</p>

<p>This temple contains five idols of a colossal stature,
sitting cross-legged upon pedestals in three recesses, which
fill the whole Northern side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Ghessur Chan, the principal
idol.</div><p>The principal idol is seated alone, in the middle
recess, between two columns, entwined with gilded dragons.
Large streamers of silk, hanging from the roof
of the temple, veil in some measure the upper part of
the image. His name is Ghedsur, or Ghessur Chan<a name="FNanchor_98_98"
id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>;
the Chinese call him Loo-ye, or the first and most antient;
and the Manshurs, Guanl&ouml;e, or the superior god.
He is of a gigantic size, surpassing more than fourfold
the human stature, with a face glistening like burnished
gold, black hair and beard. He wears a crown upon
his head, and is richly dressed in the Chinese fashion:
his garments are not moulded out of clay, as those of
the other idols; but are made of the finest silk. He
holds in his hands a kind of tablet, which he seems to
read with deep attention. Two small female figures, resembling
girls of about fourteen years of age, stand
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
each side of the idol, upon the same pedestal; one of
which grasps a roll of paper. At the right-hand of the
idol lie seven golden arrows, and at his left a bow.</p>

<p>Before the idol is a spacious enclosure, surrounded
with rails, within which stands an altar with four colossal
figures, intended probably to represent the principal
mandarins of the deified Ghessur. Two of these figures
are dressed like judges, and hold before them small
tablets, similar to that in the hands of the principal idol.
The two other figures are accoutred in complete armour:
one wears a turban; and carries, upon the left shoulder,
a large sword sheathed, with the hilt upwards. The
other has an hideous copper-coloured face, a large belly,
and grasps in his right hand a lance with a broad
blade.</p>

<p>Although all the remaining idols in the temple are of
an enormous size, yet they are greatly surpassed in magnitude
by Ghessur Chan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maooang.</div><p>The first idol in the recess
to the right is called Maooang, or the Otschibanni of the Mongols.
He has three ghastly copper-coloured faces, and six arms; two of his
arms brandish two sabres cross ways over the head; a
third bears a looking glass, and a fourth a kind of square,
which resembles a piece of ivory. The two
remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
arms are employed in drawing a bow, with an arrow laid
upon it, ready to be discharged. This idol has a mirror
upon his breast, and an eye in his navel: near it are
placed two small figures; one holds an arrow, and the
other a little animal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tsaudsing.</div><p>The next idol in the
same recess is called by the Chinese Tsaudsing, or the gold and
silver god; and by the Mongols Tsagan-Dsambala. He wears a black
cap, and is dressed, after the Chinese fashion, in sumptuous robes
of state; he bears in his hand a small jewel casket. Near him also
stand two little figures, one of which holds a truncated branch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chusho.</div><p>In the recess to the left is
the god Chusho, called by the Manshurs Chua-schan, and by the Mongols
Galdi, or the Fire God. He is represented with a frightful fiery
reddish face; clad in complete armour he wields a sword
half drawn out of the scabbard, and seems on the point
of starting up from his seat. He is attended by two
little harlbadeers, one of whom is crying; and the other
bears a fowl upon his hand, which resembles a sea-pheasant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Niu-o.</div><p>The other idol in the same
recess is the god of oxen, Niu-o. He appears to be sitting in a
composed posture; he is habited like a Mandarin, and is distinguished by
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
crown upon his head. He has, in common with the
other idols, a mirror upon his breast. The Chinese
imagine him to be the same with the Yamandaga of the
Mongols; and it is said his Manshurish name is Chain
Killova; his Mongol name, which relates to the history
of Ghessur, is Bars-Batir, the Hero of Tygers.</p>

<p>Before these several idols there are tables, or altars, on
which cakes, pastry, dried fruit, and flesh, are placed,
on festivals and prayer days: on particular occasions
even whole carcases of sheep are offered up. Tapers
and lamps are kept burning day and night before the
idols. Among the utensils of the temple, the most remarkable
is a vessel shaped like a quiver, and filled with
flat pieces of cleft reed, on which short Chinese devices
are inscribed. These devices are taken out by the Chinese
on new-years day, and are considered as oracles,
which foretel the good or ill luck of the person, by whom
they are drawn, during the following year. There lies
also upon a table an hollow wooden black lackered helmet,
which all persons of devotion strike with a wooden
hammer, whenever they enter the temple. This helmet
is regarded with such peculiar awe, that no strangers
are permitted to handle it, although they are allowed to
touch even the idols themselves.</p>

<p>The first day of the new and full moon is appointed
for the celebration of worship. Upon each of those
days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
no Chinese ever fails to make his appearance once in the
temple; he enters without taking off his cap<a name="FNanchor_99_99"
id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, joins his
hands before his face, bows five times to each idol,
touches with his forehead the pedestal on which the idol
sits, and then retires. Their principal festivals are held
in the first month of their year, which answers to February.
It is called by them, as well as by the Mongols,
the white month; and is considered as a lucky time for
the transaction of business; at that time they hoist flags
before the temples; and place meat upon the tables of
the idols, which the priests take away in the evening,
and eat in the small apartments of the interior
court. On these solemnities plays are performed in the
theatre, in honour of the idols: the pieces are generally
satyrical, and mostly written against unjust magistrates
and judges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superstion of the Chinese.</div><p>But
although the Chinese have such few ceremonies in
their system of religious worship, yet they are remarkably
infected with superstition. Mr. Pallas gives the
following description of their behaviour at Maimatschin
during an eclipse of the moon. At the close of
the evening in which the eclipse appeared, all the inhabitants
were indefatigable in raising an incessant uproar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
some by hideous shrieks, others by knocking wood, and
beating cauldrons; the din was heightened by striking
the bell and beating the kettle drums of the great Pagoda.
The Chinese suppose, that during an eclipse the
wicked spirit of the air, called by the Mongols Arachulla,
is attacking the moon; and that he is frightened
away by these hideous shrieks and noises. Another instance
of superstition fell under the observation, of Mr.
Pallas, while he was at Maimatschin. A fire broke out
in that town with such violence that several houses were
in flames. None of the inhabitants, however, attempted
to extinguish it; they stood indeed in idle consternation
round the fire; and some of them sprinkled occasionally
water among the flames, in order to sooth the fire god,
who, as they imagined, had chosen their houses for a
sacrifice. Indeed if the Russians had not exerted themselves
in quenching the fire, the whole place would probably
have been reduced to ashes<a name="FNanchor_100_100"

<div class="sidenote">Merchants of Maimatschin.</div><p>The
merchants of Maimatschin come from the
Northern provinces of China, chiefly from Pekin,
Nankin, Sandchue, and other principal towns. They
are not settled at this place with their wives and families:
for it is a remarkable circumstance, that there is
not one woman in Maimatschin. This restriction arises
from the policy of the Chinese government, which,
totally prohibits the women from having the slightest
intercourse with foreigners. No Chinese merchant
engages in the trade to Siberia who has not a partner.
These persons mutually relieve each other.
One remains for a stated time, usually a year, at
Kiachta; and when, his partner arrives with a fresh
cargo of Chinese merchandize, he then returns home
with the Russian commodities<a name="FNanchor_101_101"
id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the Chinese merchants understand the Mongol
tongue, in which language commercial affairs
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
generally transacted. Some few indeed speak broken
Russian, but their pronunciation is so soft and delicate,
that it is difficult to comprehend them. They are not
able to pronounce the R, but instead of it make use of
an L; and when two consonants come together, which
frequently occurs in the Russian tongue, they divide
them by the interposition of a vowel<a name="FNanchor_102_102"
id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. This failure
in articulating the Russian language seems peculiar to
the Chinese, and is not observable in the Calmucs,
Mongols, and other neighbouring nations<a name="FNanchor_103_103"
id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</p>

<p>The commerce between the Russians and Chinese is
entirely a trade of barter, that is, an exchange of one
merchandize for another. The Russians are prohibited
to export their own coin, nor indeed could the
Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
receive it, even should that prohibition be taken off;
for no specie is current amongst them except bullion<a
name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.
And the Russians find it more advantageous to take
merchandize in exchange, than to receive bullion at
the Chinese standard. The common method of transacting
business is as follows. The Chinese merchant
comes first to Kiachta, and examines the merchandize he
has occasion for in the warehouse of the Russian
trader;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
he then goes to the house of the latter, and adjusts
the price over a dish of tea. Both parties next return
to the magazine, and the goods in question are
there carefully sealed in the presence of the Chinese
merchant. When this ceremony is over, they both
repair to Maimatschin; the Russian chooses the commodities
he wants, not forgetting to guard against fraud by
a strict inspection. He then takes the precaution to
leave behind a person of confidence, who remains in the
warehouse until the Russian goods are delivered, when
he returns to Kiachta with the Chinese merchandize<a
name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russian Exports.</div><p class="center">The
principal commodities which Russia exports to China are as follow:</p>


<h5>FURS and PELTRY.</h5>

<p>It would be uninteresting to enumerate all the furs
and skins<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a
href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> brought for sale
to Kiachta, which form the most important article of exportation on
the side of the Russians. The most valuable of these furs are the
skins of sea-otters, beavers, foxes, wolves, bears, Bucharian
lambs, Astracan sheep, martens, sables, ermines,
grey-squirrels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest part of these furs and skins are drawn
from Siberia and the New Discovered Islands: this supply
however is not alone fully adequate to the demand
of the market at Kiachta. Foreign furs are therefore
imported to St. Petersburg, and from thence sent to the
frontiers. England alone furnishes a large quantity of
beaver and other skins, which she draws from Hudson's
Bay and Canada.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a
href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>


<h5>CLOTH.</h5>

<p>Cloth forms the second article of exportation which
Russia exports to China.</p>

most valuable commodities procured from China.</p>


<h5>RAW AND MANUFACTURED SILK.</h5>

<p>The exportation of raw silk is prohibited in China
under pain of death: large quantities however are
smuggled every year into Kiachta, but not sufficient to
answer the demands of the Russian merchants.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>The manufactured silks are of various sorts, fashions,
and prices, viz. sattins, taffaties, damasks, and gauzes,
scanes of silk died of all colours, ribbands, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>


<h5>RAW AND MANUFACTURED COTTON.</h5>

<p>Raw cotton is imported in very large quantities;
a great part of this commodity is employed in packing
up the china ware, and by these means is conveyed into<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the inland part of Russia without any additional expence
of carriage.</p>

<p>A pood sells for&mdash;from 4 roubles, 80 cop. to 12.</p>

<p>Of the manufactured cotton, that which the Russians
call Kitaika, and the English Nankeen, has the most
rapid sale. It is the most durable, and, in proportion
to its goodness, the cheapest of all the Chinese stuffs;
it is stained red, brown, green, and black.</p>


<h5>TEAS.</h5>

<p>The teas which are brought into Russia are much
superior in flavour and quality to those which are sent
to Europe from Canton. The original goodness of the
teas is probably the same in both cases; but it is conjectured,
that the transport by sea considerably impairs
the aromatic flavour of the plant. This commodity,
now become so favourite an object of European luxury,
is esteemed by the Russian merchants the most profitable
article of importation.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to procure the genuine Thibet
musk, because the Chinese purchase a bad sort, which
comes from Siberia, with which they adulterate that
which is brought from Thibet<a name="FNanchor_113_113"

<div class="sidenote">Advantages of this Trade to
Russia.</div><p>Russia draws great advantages from the Chinese trade.
By this traffic, its natural productions, and particularly
its furs and skins, are disposed of in a very profitable
manner. Many of these furs procured from the
most Easterly parts of Siberia, are of such little value
that they would not answer the expence of carriage into
Russia; while the richer furs, which are sold to the
Chinese at a very high price, would, on account of
their dearness, seldom meet with purchasers in the Russian
dominions. In exchange for these commodities the
Russians receive from China several valuable articles of
commerce, which they would otherwise be obliged to buy
at a much dearer rate from the European powers, to the
great disadvantage of the balance of their trade.</p>

<p>I have before observed, that formerly the exportation
and importation of the most valuable goods were prohibited
to individuals; at present only the following articles
are prohibited. Among the exports, fire-arms and
artillery; gunpowder and ball; gold and silver,
coined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and uncoined, stallions and mares; skins of deer, reindeer,
elks, and horses; beaver's hair, potash, rosin,
thread, and<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a

the imports, salt, brandy, poisons, copper-money, and rhubarb.</p>

<p>One per cent. is also deducted from the price of all
goods for the expence of deepening the river Selenga;
and 7 per cent for the support of the custom-house.</p>

<p>Some articles, both of export and import, pay no duty.
The exported are, writing, royal, and post paper, Russia
cloth of all sorts and colours, excepting peasants cloth.
The imported are, satins, raw and stained cottons, porcelain,
earthen-ware, glass corals, beads, fans, all musical
instruments, furniture, lackered and enamelled ornaments,
needles, white-lead, rice, preserved ginger,
and other sweet-meats<a name="FNanchor_115_115"

<i>Description of Zuruchaitu&mdash;and its trade&mdash;Transport of
the merchandise through Siberia.</i></h4>


<p>The general account of the Russian commerce to
China has been given in the preceding chapter,
because almost the whole traffic is confined to Kiachta.
The description of Zuruchaitu, which was also fixed by
the treaty of Kiachta for the purpose of carrying on the
same trade, will be comprised of course in a narrow
compass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description of Zuruchaitu.</div><p>Zuruchaitu
is situated in 137&deg; longitude, and 49&deg;. 20&acute;
N. latitude, upon the Western branch of the river Argoon,
at a small distance from its source. It is provided
with a small garrison, and a few wretched barracks surrounded
with chevaux de frise. No merchants are settled
at this place; they come every summer from Nershinsk,
and other Russian towns in order to meet two parties of
Mongol troops: these troops are sent from the Chinese
towns Naun and Merghen, and arrive at the frontiers
about July. They encamp near Zuruchaitu upon the
other side of the river Argoon, and barter with
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Siberian merchants a few Chinese commodities, which they bring with
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commerce.</div><p>Formerly the commerce
carried on at Zuruchaitu was
more considerable; but at present it is so trifling, that
it hardly deserves to be mentioned. These Mongols
furnish the district of Nershinsk with bad tea and tobacco,
bad silks, and some tolerable cottons. They receive
in return ordinary furs, cloth, cattle, and Russian
leather. This trade lasts about a month or six weeks,
and the annual duties of the customs amount upon an
average to no more than 500 roubles. About the middle
of August the Mongols retire; part proceed immediately
to China, and the others descend the stream of
the Amoor as far as its mouth, in order to observe if
there has been no usurpation upon the limits. At the
same time the Russian merchants return to Nershinsk,
and, were it not for the small garrison, Zuruchaitu would
remain uninhabited<a name="FNanchor_117_117"
id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transport of the Russian and Chinese Commodities
through Siberia.</div><p>The Russian commodities are transported by
land from Petersburg and Moscow to Tobolsk. From thence
the merchants may embark upon the Irtish down to its
junction with the Oby; then they either tow up their
boats, or sail up the last mentioned river as far
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Marym, where they enter the Ket, which they ascend
to Makoffskoi Ostrog. At that place the merchandize is
carried about ninety versts by land to the Yenisei. The
merchants then ascend that river, the Tunguska, and
Angara, to Irkutsk, cross the lake Baikal, and go up
the river Selenga almost to Kiachta.</p>

<p>It is a work of such difficulty to ascend the streams
of so many rapid rivers, that this navigation Eastwards
can hardly be finished in one summer<a name="FNanchor_118_118"
id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>; for which
reason the merchants commonly prefer the way by land.
Their general rendezvous is the fair of Irbit near Tobolsk;
from thence they go in sledges during winter to
Kiachta where they arrive about February, the season
in which the chief commerce is carried on with the
Chinese. They buy in their route all the furs they find
in the small towns, where they are brought from the
adjacent countries. When the merchants return in
spring with the Chinese goods, which are of greater bulk
and weight than the Russian commodities, they proceed
by water; they then descend the streams of most of
the rivers, namely, the Selenga, Angara, Tunguska, Ket,
and Oby to its junction with the Irtish; they ascend
that river to Tobolsk, and continue by land to Moscow
and Petersburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transport of the Furs from Kamtchatka to
Kiachta.</div><p>Before the passage from Ochotsk to Bolcheresk was
discovered in 1716, the only communication between
Kamtchatka and Siberia was by land; the road lay
by Anadirsk to Yakutsk. The furs<a name="FNanchor_119_119"
id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> of Kamtchatka
and of the Eastern isles are now conveyed from
that peninsula by water to Ochotsk; from thence
to Yakutsk by land on horse-back, or by rein-deer:
the roads are so very bad, lying either through a
rugged mountainous country, or through marshy forests,
that the journey lasts at least six weeks. Yakutsk
is situated upon the Lena, and is the principal town,
where the choicest furs are brought in their way to
Kiachta, as well from Kamtchatka as from the Northern
parts of Siberia, which lay upon the rivers Lena, Yana,
and Endigirka. At Yakutsk the goods are embarked
upon the Lena, towed up the stream of that river as far
as Vercholensk, or still farther to Katsheg; from thence
they are transported over a short tract of land to the
rivulet Buguldeika, down that stream to the lake Baikal,
across that lake to the mouth of the Selenga, and up
that river to the neighbourhood of Kiachta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to give the reader some notion of that vast
tract of country, over which the merchandize is frequently
transported by land carriage, a list of the distances
is here subjoined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Krenitzin and Levasheff sail from the Mouth
of the Kamtchatka River, 1768.</div><p>On the 23d of July Captain
Krenitzin sailed in the Galliot St. Catherine from the mouth of
the Kamtchatka river towards America: he was accompanied by
Lieutenant Levasheff, in the Hooker St. Paul. Their
instructions were regulated by information derived from
Beering's expedition in 1741. Shaping their course accordingly,
they found themselves more to the North
than they expected; and were told by the Russian
traders and hunters, that a similar<a name="FNanchor_121_121"
id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121"
class="fnanchor">[121]</a> mistake was com<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>mitted
in the chart of that expedition. These traders,
who for some years past were accustomed to ramble to
the distant islands in quest of furs, said that they were
situated much more to the South, and farther East than
was imagined. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>They
reach Beering's Island.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> On
the 27th they saw Commodore's or
Beering's Island, which is low and rocky, especially to
the S. W. On this side they observed a small harbour,
distinguished by two hillocks like boats, and not far
from it they found a fresh water lake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and Copper Island.</div><p>To the S. E.
lies another island, called by the Russians
Mednoi Ostroff, or Copper Island, from a great quantity
of copper found upon its N. E. coast, the only side which
is known to the Russians. It is washed up by the sea,
and covers the shore in such abundance, that many ships
may load with it. Perhaps an India trader might make
a profitable voyage from thence to China, where this
metal is in high demand. This copper is mostly in a
metallic or malleable state, and many pieces seem as if
they had formerly been in fusion. The island is not
high, but has many hillocks, each of which has the
appearance of having formerly been the funnel of a
volcano. We may here, once for all, observe, that all the
islands represented in this chart<a name="FNanchor_122_122"
id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> abound with such
funnels, called in Russian Sopka, in so much that no
island, however small, was found without one;
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
many of them consisted of nothing else. In short,
the chain of islands here laid down may, without any
violent stretch of imagination, be considered as thrown
up by some late volcanos. The apparent novelty of
every thing seems to justify this conjecture: nor can
any objection be derived from the vegetable productions
with which these islands abound; for the summer after
the lower district of Zutphen in Holland was gained
from the sea, it was covered over with wild mustard.
All these lands are subject to violent and frequent earth-quakes,
and abound in sulphur. The writer of the
journal was not able to inform us whether any lava was
found upon them; but he speaks of a party-coloured
stone as heavy as iron. From this account it is by no
means improbable, that the copper abovementioned has
been melted in some eruption.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrive at the Fox Islands.</div><p>After
leaving Copper Island, no land was seen from
either of the ships (which had parted company in a fog)
till on the S. E. quarter of their tract, was discovered
the chain of islands or head-lands laid down in the
chart. These in general appeared low, the shore bad,
without creeks, and the water between them very shallow.
During their course outwards, as well as during
their return, they had frequent fogs. It appears from
the journal, as well as from the relation of the
hunters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
that it is very uncommon to have clear weather for five
days together, even during summer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Krenitzin winters at Alaxa.</div><p>The
St. Catherine wintered in the straits of Alaxa,
where they hauled her into shoal water. The instructions
given to the captain set forth, that a private ship had
in 1762 found there a commodious haven; but he
looked for it in vain. The entrance of this strait from
the N. E. was extremely difficult on account of flats, and
strong currents both flood and ebb: the entrance however
from the S. E. was afterwards found to be much easier
with not less than 5-1/2 fathoms water. Upon surveying
this strait, and the coast of Alaxa, many funnels
were observed in the low grounds close to the
shore, and the soil produced few plants. May not
this allow one to suppose that the coast had suffered
considerable changes since the year 1762? Few of
the islands produce wood, and that only in the vallies
by the rivulets. Unalga and Alaxa contain the
most; they abound with fresh water streams, and even
rivers; from which we may infer that they are extensive.
The soil is in general boggy, and covered with
moss; but Alaxa has more soil and produces much grass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Levasheff winters upon Unalashka.</div><p>The
St. Paul wintered in Unalashka. This wintering
place was observed to lie in 53&deg; 29&acute; North latitude, and
its longitude from the mouth of Kamtchatka
river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
computed by the ship's journal, was 27&deg; 05&acute; East<a
name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. Unalashka
is about fifty miles long from N. E. to S. W.
and has on the N. E. side three bays. One of them
called Udagha stretches thirty miles E. N. E. and
W. S. W. nearly through the middle of the
island. Another called Igunck, lying N. N. E. and
S. S. W. is a pretty good harbour, with three and a half
fathom water at high tide, and sandy ground. It is well
sheltered from the North swell at its entrance by rocks,
some of which are under water. The tide flows here
five feet at full and change, and the shore is in general
bold and rocky, except in the bay, at the mouth of a
small river. There are two burning mountains on this
island, one called Ayaghish, and the other (by the Russians)
the Roaring Mountain. Near the former is a
very copious hot spring. The land is in general rocky,
with loamy and clayey grounds; but the grass is extremely
coarse, and unfit for pasture. Hardly any wood
is to be found on it. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Productions of
Unalashka.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Its plants are dwarf
cherry (<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a
href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>Xylosteum
of Tournefort), wortle berry, (Vaccinium Uliginosum
of Linn&aelig;us), rasberry, farana and shikshu of
Kamtchatka and kutage, larch, white poplar, pine
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
birch<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a
href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. The land animals are foxes of different colours,
mice, and weasels; there are also beavers<a name="FNanchor_126_126"
id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>, sea cats, and
sea lions as at Kamtchatka. Among their fish we may
reckon cod, perch, pilchards, smelts, roach, needle fish,
terpugh, and tchavitcha. The birds are eagles, partridges,
ducks, teals, urili, ari, and gadi. The animals
for whose Russian names I can find no translations,
are (excepting the Ari) described in Krashininikoff's History
of Kamtchatka, or in Steller's relation contained in
the second volume of the Memoirs of the Academy of
Petersburgh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Account of the Inhabitants of the Fox
Islands.</div><p>The inhabitants of Alaxa, Umnak, Unalaksha, and
the neighbouring islands, are of a middle stature, tawny
brown colour, and black hair. In summer they wear
coats (parki<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>) made of bird skins, over which, in bad
weather, and in their boats, they throw cloaks, called
kamli, made of thin whale guts. On their heads they
wear wooden caps, ornamented with duck's feathers,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
and the ears of the sea-animal, called Scivutcha or sea-lion;
they also adorn these caps with beads of different
colours, and with little figures of bone or stone. In
the partition of the nostrils they place a pin, about
four inches long, made of the bone, or of the stalk
of a certain black plant; from the ends of this pin or
bodkin they hang, in fine weather and on festivals, rows
of beads, one below the other. They thrust beads, and
bits of pebble cut like teeth, into holes made in the under-lips.
They also wear strings of beads in their ears,
with bits of amber, which the inhabitants of the other
islands procure from Alaxa, in exchange for arrows and
kamli.</p>

<p>They cut their hair before just above the eyes, and
some shave the top of their heads like monks. Behind
the hair is loose. The dress of the women hardly differs
from that of the men, excepting that it is made
of fish-skins. They sew with bone needles, and thread
made of fish guts, fastening their work to the ground
before them with bodkins. They go with the head
uncovered, and the hair cut like that of the men before,
but tied up behind in a high knot. They paint
their cheeks with strokes of blue and red, and wear
nose-pins, beads, and ear-rings like the men; they hang
beads round their neck, and checkered strings round
their arms and legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Manners and Customs.</div><p>In their
persons we should reckon them extremely
nasty. They eat the vermin with which their bodies
are covered, and swallow the mucus from the nose.
Having washed themselves, according to custom, first
with urine, and then with water, they suck their hands
dry. When they are sick, they lie three or four days
without food; and if bleeding is necessary, they open a
vein with lancets made of flint, and suck the blood.</p>

<p>Their principal nourishment is fish and whale fat,
which they commonly eat raw. They also feed upon
sea-wrack and roots, particularly the saran, a species of
lily; they eat a herb, called kutage, on account of its
bitterness, only with fish or fat. They sometimes kindle
fire by catching a spark among dry leaves and powder of
sulphur: but the most common method is by rubbing
two pieces of wood together, in the manner practised at
Kamtchatka<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a
href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>, and which
Vaksel, Beering's lieutenant, found to be in use in that part of
North America which he saw in 1741. They are very fond of Russian
oil and butter, but not of bread. They could not be
pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>vailed upon to taste any sugar until the commander
shewed the example; finding it sweet, they put it up
to carry it home to their wives.</p>

<p>The houses of these islanders are huts built precisely
in the manner of those in Kamtchatka, with the entry
through a hole in the middle of the roof. In one of
these huts live several families, to the amount of thirty
or forty persons. They keep themselves warm by
means of whale fat burnt in shells, which they place
between their legs. The women set apart from the
men.</p>

<p>Six or seven of these huts or yourts make a village,
of which there are sixteen in Unalashka. The islands
seem in general to be well inhabited, as may be conjectured
from the great number of boats which are seen
continually plying along the shore. There are upwards
of a thousand inhabitants on Unalashka, and they say
that it was formerly much more populous. They have
suffered greatly by their disputes with the Russians, and
by a famine in the year 1762; but most of all from
a change in their way of life. No longer contented
with their original simplicity, they long for Russian
luxuries: in order therefore to obtain a few delicacies,
which are presently consumed, they dedicate the greatest
part of their time to hunting, for the purpose of
pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>curing furs for the Russians: by these means, they
neglect to lay up a provision of fish and roots; and
suffer their children frequently to die of hunger.</p>

<p>Their principal food is fish, which they catch with
bone hooks. Their boats, in which they row to a
great distance from land, are made, like those of the
Innuet or Esquimaux, of thin slips of wood and skins:
these skins cover the top as well as the sides of the
boat, and are drawn tight round the waist of the
rower. The oar is a paddle, broad at both ends. Some
of their boats hold two persons; one of whom rows,
and the other fishes: but these kind of boats seem
appropriated to their chiefs. They have also large
boats capable of holding forty men. They kill birds
and beasts with darts made of bone, or of wood tipped
with sharpened stone: they use these kind of darts in
war, which break with the blow given by them, and
leave the point in the wound.</p>

<p>The manners and character of these people are what
we should expect from their necessitous situation, extremely
rude and savage. The inhabitants however of
Unalashka are somewhat less barbarous in their manners
and behaviour to each other, and also more civil to
strangers than the natives of the other islands;
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
even they are engaged in frequent and bloody quarrels,
and commit murder without the least compunction.
Their disposition engages them in continual wars, in
which they always endeavour to gain their point by
stratagem. The inhabitants of Unimak are formidable
to all the rest; they frequently invade the other islands,
and carry off women, the chief object of their wars.
Alaxa is most subject to these incursions, probably because
it is more populous and extensive. They all
join in hating the Russians, whom they consider as general
invaders, and therefore kill them wherever they
can. The people of Unalashka however are more
friendly; for Lieutenant Levasheff, being informed that
there was a Russian vessel in the straits of Alaxa,
prevailed on some Unalashkans to carry a letter, which
they undertook, notwithstanding the danger they were
exposed to from the inhabitants of the intervening
islands.</p>

<p>The journalist says, that these people have no kind
of religion, nor any notion of a God. We observe
however among them sufficient marks of such a religion
as might be expected from people in their situation.
For the journalist informs us, that they have fortune-tellers
employed by them at their festivals. These persons
pretend to foretel events by the information of the
Kugans or D&aelig;mons. In their divinations they put
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
wooden masks, made in the form in which they say
the Kugan appeared to them; they then dance with
violent motions, beating at the same time drums covered
with fish skins. The inhabitants also wear little figures
on their caps, and place others round their huts, to keep
off the devils. These are sufficient marks of a savage
religion.</p>

<p>It is common for them to have two, three, or four
wives, and some have also an object of unnatural affection,
who is dressed like the women. The wives do not
all live together, but, like the Kamtchadals, in different
yourts. It is not unusual for the men to exchange their
wives, and even sell them, in time of dearth, for a bladder
of fat; the husband afterwards endeavours to get
back his wife, if she is a favourite, and if unsuccessful
he sometimes kills himself. When strangers arrive
at a village, it is always customary for the women to
go out to meet them, while the men remain at home:
this is considered as a pledge of friendship and security.
When a man dies in the hut belonging to his wife, she
retires into a dark hole, where she remains forty days.
The husband pays the same compliment to his favourite
wife upon her death. When both parents die, the children
are left to shift for themselves. The Russians found
many in this situation, and some were brought for
sale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>
<p>In each village there is a sort of chief, called Tookoo,
who is not distinguished by any particular rank or authority.
He decides differences by arbitration, and the
neighbours enforce the sentence. When he goes out to
sea he is exempted from working, and has a servant,
called Kal&egrave;, for the purpose of rowing the canoe; this is
the only mark of his dignity: at all other times he labours
like the rest. The office is not hereditary; but is generally
conferred on him who is most remarkable for his
personal qualities; or who possesses a great influence by
the number of his friends. Hence it frequently happens,
that the person who has the largest family is
chosen.</p>

<p>During their festivals, which are held after the fishing
season ends in April, the men and women sing songs;
the women dance, sometimes singly, and sometimes in
pairs, waving in their hands blown bladders; they begin
with gentle movements, which become at last extremely
violent.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Unalashka are called Kogholaghi.
Those of Akutan, and farther East to Unimak, are called
Kighigusi; and those of Unimak and Alaxa are called
Kataghayekiki. They cannot tell whence they have
these names, and now begin to call themselves by the
general name of Aleyut, given them by the
Russians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and borrowed from some of the<a name="FNanchor_129_129"
id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>Kuril islands. Upon
being asked concerning their origin, they said that they
had always inhabited these islands, and knew nothing of
any other country beyond them. All that could be gathered
from them was, that the greatest numbers came
from Alaxa, and that they did not know whether that
land had any bounds. The Russians surveyed this island
very far to the N. E. in boats, being out about a fortnight,
and set up a cross at the end of their survey. The
boats of the islanders are like those of the Americans. It
appears however from their customs and way of life, so
far as these are not necessarily prescribed to them by
their situation, that they are of Kamtchatdal original.
Their huts, their manner of kindling fire, and their objects
of unnatural affections, lead to this conjecture. Add
to this, the almost continual Westerly winds, which must
render the passage Westward extremely difficult. Beering
and Tchirikoff could never obtain Easterly winds but by
going to the Southward.</p>

<p>The Russians have for some years past been accustomed
to go to these islands in quest of furs, of which they
have imposed a tax on the inhabitants. The manner of
carrying on this trade is as follows. The Russian traders
go in Autumn to Beering's and Copper island, and there
winter: they then employ themselves in catching
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
sea-cat, and afterwards the Scivutcha, or sea-lion. The
flesh of the latter is prepared for food, and it is very delicate.
They carry the skins of these sea-animals to the
Eastern islands. Next summer they go Eastward, to the
Fox-islands; and again lay their ships up for the winter.
They then endeavour to procure, either by persuasion
or force, the children of the inhabitants, particularly of
the Tookoos, as hostages. This being accomplished,
they deliver to the inhabitants fox-traps, and also skins
for their boats, for which they oblige them to bring furs
and provisions during the winter. After obtaining from
them a certain quantity of furs, by way of tax, for which
they give them quittances; the Russians pay for the rest
in beads, false pearls, goat's wool, copper kettles, hatchets,
&amp;c. In the spring they get back their traps, and deliver
up their hostages. They dare not hunt alone, nor in
small numbers, on account of the hatred of the natives.
These people could not, for some time, comprehend for
what purpose the Russians imposed a tribute of skins,
which were not to be their own property, but belonged
to an absent person; for their Tookoos have no revenue.
Nor could they be made to believe, that there were any
more Russians than those who came among them; for
in their own country all the men of an island go out
together. At present they comprehend something of
Kamtchatka, by means of the Kamtchadals and Koriacs
who come along with the Russians; and on their
arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
love to associate with people whose manner of life resembles their own.</p>

<p>Krenitzin and Levasheff returned from this expedition
into the mouth of the Kamtchatka river in autumn 1769.</p>

<p>The chart which accompanies this journal was composed
by the pilot Jacob Yakoff, under the inspection of

Levasheff. The track of the St. Paul is marked both in going out
and returning. The harbour of the St. Paul in the island Unalashka,
and the straits of Alaxa, are laid down from observations
made during the winter 1768; and the islands
connected by bearings and distances taken during a cruise
of the St. Paul twice repeated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Longitude of the extreme Parts of
Asia.</div><p>The important question concerning the longitude
of the extreme parts of Asia has been so differently
stated by the most celebrated geographers, that it
may not be amiss to refer the curious reader to the
principal treatises upon that subject. <span class="sni"><span

Geographers.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The proofs by
which Mr. Muller and the Russian geographers place the
longitude of the Eastern extremity of Asia beyond 200
degrees from the first meridian of Fero, or 180&deg; 6&acute;
15&acute;&acute; from Paris, are drawn from the observations of the
satellites of Jupiter, made by Krassilnikoff at Kamtchatka,
and in different parts of Siberia, and from the expeditions
of the Russians by land and sea towards Tschukotskoi
Noss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">by Mr. Vaugondy.</div><p>It appears to
Monsieur de Vaugondy, that there are
not sufficient grounds for so extraordinary a diminution:
accordingly he shortens the continent of Asia only
eleven degrees of longitude; and upon this subject he
has given the two following treatises:</p>

<p>In this memoir he dissents from the opinions of
Messrs Engel and Vaugondy; and defends the system
of the Russian geographers in the following manner.
Monsieur Maraldi, after comparing the observations
of the satellites of Jupiter, taken at Kamtchatka by
Krassilnikoff, with the tables, has determined the longitude
of Ochotsk, Bolcheresk, and the port of St. Peter
and Paul from the first meridian of Paris as follows:</p>

will shew from their near agreement the care

the suspicions of inaccuracy imputed to Krassilnikoff

<p>In order to call in question the conclusions drawn from
the observations of Krassilnikoff, Monsieur de Vaugondy
pretends that the instruments and pendulums, which he
made use of at Kamtchatka, were much damaged by the
length of the journey; and that the person who was
sent to repair them was an unskilful workman. But
this opinion seems to have been advanced without sufficient
foundation. Indeed Krassilnikoff<a name="FNanchor_133_133"
id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> himself allows
that his pendulum occasionally stopt, even when
necessary to ascertain the true time of the observation.
He admits therefore that the observations which he took
under these disadvantages (when he could not correct
them by preceding or subsequent observations of the sun
or stars) are not to be depended upon, and has accordingly
distinguished them by an asterisk; there are however
a number of others, which were not liable to any
exception of this kind; and the observations already
mentioned in this number are comprised under this class.</p>

<p>If the arguments which have been already produced
should not appear sufficiently satisfactory, we have the
further testimony of Mr. Muller, who was in those parts
at the same time with Krassilnikoff, and who is the only
competent judge of this matter now alive. For that
re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>spectable author has given me the most positive assurances,
that the instruments were not damaged in such a
manner as to effect the accuracy of the observations when
in the hands of a skilful observer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accuracy of the Russian
Geographers.</div><p>That the longitude of Kamtchatka is laid down
with sufficient accuracy by the Russian geographers, will appear
by comparing it with the longitude of Yakutsk; for
as the latter has been clearly established by a variety of
observations, taken at different times and by different
persons, if there is any error in placing Kamtchatka so
far to the East, it will be found in the longitude between
Yakutsk and Bolcheresk. A short comparison therefore
of some of the different observations made at Yakutsk
will help to settle the longitude of Kamtchatka, and
will still farther confirm the character of a skilful observer,
which has been given to Krassilnikoff.</p>

<p>Krassilnikoff in returning from Kamtchatka observed
at Yakutsk several eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter,
of which the following are mentioned by him as the
most exact.</p>

<p>The observations of Mr. Islenieff<a name="FNanchor_135_135"
id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, made at Yakutsk in
the year 1769, to which place he was sent to observe
the transit of Venus, have received the sanction of the
Imperial Academy. The longitude which he fixes for
Yakutsk is 8<sup>h</sup> 29&acute; 34&acute;&acute;. this corresponds, to a sufficient
degree of exactness, with the longitude inferred from,
the observations of Krassilnikoff.</p>

<p>Thus the longitude of Yakutsk from Paris being 8<sup>h</sup>
29&deg; 4&acute;&acute;. or in degrees 127 16 0. and of Bolcheresk
10 17 17, or in degrees 150&deg; 19&acute; 15. the difference of
the longitude of these two places, from astronomical observations,
amounts to 1 48 8. or in degrees 27&deg; 3&acute; 0. The latitude of
Bolcheresk is 52&deg; 55&acute; 0&acute;&acute;. and that of Yakutsk
62&deg; 1&acute; 50&acute;&acute;. and the difference
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
their longitudes being from the preceding determination
27 3 0. the direct distance between the places
measured on a great circle of the earth will appear by
trigonometry to be 16&deg; 57&acute;. or about 1773 versts reckoning
104-1/2 versts to a degree. This distance consists
partly of sea, and partly of land; and a constant intercourse
is kept up between the two places, by means of
Ochotsk, which lies between them. The distance by sea
from Bolcheresk to Ochotsk is estimated by ships reckonings
to be 1254 versts, and the distance by land from
Ochotsk to Yakutsk is 927 versts, making altogether
2181. The direct distance deduced by trigonometry,
(on a supposition that the difference of longitude between
Bolcheresk and Yakutsk is 27&deg; 3&acute;.) is 1773, falling
short of 2181 by 408. a difference naturally to be expected
from considering, that neither roads by land, or
the course of ships at sea, are ever performed precisely
on a great circle of the earth, which is the shortest line
that can be drawn on the earth's surface between two
places.</p>

<p>By this agreement between the distance thus estimated,
and that deduced by computation, on supposing the difference
of longitude between Yakutsk and Bolcheresk to
be 27&deg; 3&acute;. it seems very improbable, that there should
be an error of many degrees in the astronomical determination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>
<p>Since then the longitude between Fero and Petersburgh
is acknowledged to be 48&deg;&mdash;that between Petersburgh
and Yakutsk 99&deg; 21&acute;&mdash;and as the distance in longitude
between Yakutsk and Bolcheresk cannot be materially
less than 27&deg; 3&acute;. it follows that the longitude of
Bolcheresk from Fero cannot be much less than 174&deg; 24&acute;.
Where then shall we find place for so great an error as
27 degrees, which, according to Mr. Engel, or even of
11&deg;. which, according to Mons. Vaugondy, is imputed
to the Russian geographers, in fixing the longitude of
Kamtchatka?</p>

botanists peculiar to America.</p>

<i>List of the principal charts representing the Russian
discoveries.</i></h4>


<p>The following is an authentic list of the principal
charts of the Russian discoveries hitherto published.
It is accompanied with a few explanatory remarks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">List of the Charts of the Russian
Discoveries</div><p>1. Carte des nouvelles d&egrave;couvertes au nord
de la mer du sud, tant &agrave; l'Est de la Siberie et du Kamtchatka,
qu'&agrave; l'Ouest de la Nouvelle France dress&eacute; sur les
memoires de Mr. de l'Isle, par Philippe Buache, 1750. A memoir
relative to this chart was soon afterwards published, with
the following title, Explication de la carte des nouvelles
d&egrave;couvertes au Nord de la mer du sud par Mr. de l'Isle
Paris, 1752, 4to.</p>

<p>This map is alluded to, p. 26 of this work.</p>

raison dans un memoire separ&eacute;: &agrave; St. Petersburg,

<p>This map was published under the inspection of Mr.
Muller, and is still prefixed to his account of the Russian
discoveries<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a
href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. The part
which exhibits the new discovered
isles and the coast of America, was chiefly taken from
the chart of Beering's expedition. Accordingly that continent
is represented as advancing, between 50 and 60
degrees of latitude, to within a small distance of Kamtchatka.
Nor could there be any reason to suspect, that
such experienced sailors as Beering and Tschirikoff had
mistaken a chain of islands for promontories belonging to
America, until subsequent navigators had actually sailed
through that very part, which was supposed to be a
continent.</p>

<p>4. A second chart published by the Academy, but not
under the inspection of Mr. Muller, bears the same title
as the former.</p>

<p>Nouvelle carte des d&egrave;couvertes faites par des vaisseaux
Russiens aut c&ocirc;t&eacute;s inconnus de l'Amerique, &amp;c. 1773.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<p>It is for the most part a copy of a manuscript chart
known in Russia by the name of the chart of the Promyshlenics,
or merchant adventurers, and which was
sketched from the mere reports of persons who had sailed
to the New Discovered Islands. As to the size and position
of the New Discovered Islands, this chart of the
Academy is extremely erroneous: it is however free
from the above-mentioned mistake, which runs through
all the former charts, namely, the representing of the
coast of America, between 50 and 60 degrees of latitude,
as contiguous to Kamtchatka. It likewise removes
that part of the same continent lying in latitude
66, from 210&deg; longitude to 224&deg;, and in its stead lays
down a large island, which stretches between latitude
64&deg; and 71&deg; 30&acute;, from 207&deg; longitude to 218&deg;, to
within a small distance of both continents. But whether
this latter alteration be equally justifiable or not,
is a question, the decision of which must be left to future
navigators<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a
href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Carte du nouvel Archipel du Nord decouvert
parles Russes dans la mer de Kamtchatka et d'Anadir.</p>

<p>This chart is prefixed to Mr. St&aelig;hlin's account of the
New Northern Archipelago. In the English translation
it is called, A Map of the New Northern Archipelago,
discovered by the Russians in the seas of Kamtchatka
and Anadyr. It differs from the last mentioned chart
only in the size and position of a few of the islands,
and in the addition of five or six new ones, and is
equally incorrect. The New Discovered Islands are
classed in this chart into three groups, which are called
the Isles of Anadyr<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>, the Olutorian<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Isles, and the Ale&uuml;tian
Isles. The two last mentioned charts are alluded
to, p. 26 of this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>6. An excellent map of the Empire of Russia, published
by the geographical department of the Academy
of Sciences at St. Petersburg in 1776, comprehends the
greatest part of the New Discovered Islands. A reduced
copy of this chart being prefixed to this work, I shall
only mention the authorities from whence the compilers
have laid down the New Discovered Islands.
The Ale&uuml;tian Isles are partly taken from Beering's
chart, partly from<a name="FNanchor_146_146"
id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>Otcheredin's, whose voyage is related
in the eleventh chapter, and partly from other MS.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg
286]</a></span>charts of different navigators. The islands near the
coast of the Tschutski are copied from Synd's chart.
The Fox Islands are laid down from the chart of Otcheredin.
The reader will perceive, that the position of
the Fox Islands, upon this general map of Russia, is
materially different from that assigned to them in the
chart of Krenitzin's and Levasheff's voyage. In the
former they are represented as stretching between
56&deg; 61&acute; North latitude, and 210&deg; and 230&deg; longitude
from the isle of Fero: in the latter they are situated
between 51&deg; 40&acute; and 55&deg; 20&acute; latitude, and 199&deg;
30&acute; and 207&deg; 30&acute; longitude. According to the most
recent accounts received from Petersburg, the position given to
them upon this general map is considerably too much
to the North and East; consequently that assigned to
them upon Krenitzin's chart is probably the most to be
depended upon.</p>

<p>7. Carte des d&egrave;couvertes Russes dans la mer orientale
et en Amerique, pour servir &agrave; l'Essai<a name="FNanchor_147_147"
id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> sur le
com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>merce de Russie, 1778, Amsterdam. It is natural to
expect, that a chart so recently published should be superior
to all the preceding ones; whereas, on the contrary,
it is by far the most incorrect representation of
the New Discovered Islands which has yet appeared.</p>

<i>Position of the</i> Andreanoffsky Isles <i>ascertained&mdash;Number
of the</i> Ale&uuml;tian Isles.</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Position of the Andreanoffsky
Isles.</div><p>When the anonymous author published his account
of the Russian Discoveries in 1766, the
position of the Andreanoffsky Isles was not ascertained.
It was generally supposed, that they formed part of that
cluster of islands, which Synd<a name="FNanchor_148_148"
id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> fell in with in his voyage
towards Tschukotskoi Noss; and Buffon<a name="FNanchor_149_149"
id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> represents
them to be the same with those laid down in St&aelig;hlin's
chart, under the name of Anadirsky Isles. The anonymous
author in the passage here referred to, supposes
them to be N. E. of the Ale&uuml;tian Isles; "at the distance
of 600 or 800 versts; that their direction is probably
East and West, and that some of them may unite
with that part of the Fox Islands which are most
contiguous to the opposite continent." This conjecture
was advanced upon a supposition that the
Andreanoffsky Isles lay near the coast of the
Tschutski;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289"
id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
and that some of the Fox Islands were situated in latitude
61, as they are laid down upon the general map
of Russia. But according to subsequent information,
the Andreanoffsky Isles lie between the Ale&uuml;tian and the
Fox Islands, and complete the connection between
Kamtchatka and America<a name="FNanchor_150_150"
id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. Their chain is supposed to
begin in about latitude 53, near the most Easterly of the
Ale&uuml;tian Isles, and to extend in a scattered series towards
the Fox Islands. The most North Easterly of these
islands are said to be so near the most Southerly of the
Fox Islands, that they seem occasionally to have been
taken for them. An instance of this occurs in p. 61
and 62 of this work; where Atchu and Amlach are
reckoned among the Fox Islands. It is however more
probable, that they are part of the group called by the
Ale&uuml;tian chief Negho<a name="FNanchor_151_151"
id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>, and known to the Russians
under the name of Andreanoffsky Islands, because they
were supposed to have been first discovered by Andrean
Tolstyk, whose voyage is related in the seventh chapter
of the First Part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Number of the Ale&uuml;tian Isles.</div><p>I
take this opportunity of adding, that the anonymous

class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
discoveries, mentions only three; namely, Attak, Semitshi,
Shemiya. But the Ale&uuml;tian Isles consist of a
much larger number; and their chain includes all the
islands comprehended by the islander in the two groups
of Khao and Sasignan<a name="FNanchor_152_152"
id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. Many of them are laid down

<i>Conjectures concerning the proximity of the</i> Fox Islands <i>to
the continent of</i> America.</h4>


<p>The anonymous author, in the course of his account
of the Russian discoveries, has advanced
many proofs drawn from natural history, from which
he supposes the Fox Islands to be at a small distance
from the continent of America: hence he grounds his
conjecture, that "the time is not far distant when some
of the Russian navigators will fall in with that coast."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proofs of the Vicinity of the Fox Islands to
America.</div><p>The small willows and alders which, according to
Glottoff, were found growing upon Kadyak, do not appear
to have been sufficient either in size or quantity
to ascertain, with any degree of certainty, the close vicinity
of that island to America. River-otters, wolves,
bears, and wild boars, which were observed upon the
same island, will perhaps be thought to afford a stronger
presumption in favour of a neighbouring continent;
martens were also caught there, an animal which is not
known in the Eastern ports of Siberia, nor found upon
any of the other islands. All the above mentioned animals,
martens alone excepted, were seen upon Alaksu,
which is situated more to the North East than Kadyak,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and also rein-deers and wild dogs. To these proofs
drawn from natural history, we must add the reports of
a mountainous country covered with forests, and of a
great promontory called Atachtak, lying still more to the
N. E. which were prevalent among the inhabitants of
Alaksu and Kadyak.</p>

<p>Although these circumstances have been already mentioned<a
name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>,
yet I have thought proper to recapitulate them
here, in order to lay before the reader in one point of
view the several proofs advanced by the anonymous author,
which seem to shew, that the Fox Islands are situated
near America. Many of them afford, beyond a doubt,
evident signs of a less open sea; and give certain marks
of a nearer approach towards the opposite continent.
But how far that distance may be supposed, must be
left to the judgment of the reader; and remains to be
ascertained by subsequent navigators. All that we know for
certain, is, that as far as any Russian vessels have hitherto
sailed, a chain of islands has been discovered lying E. or
N. E. by E. from Kamtchatka, and stretching towards
America. Part of this chain has only been touched at;
the rest is unknown; and all beyond is uncertainty
and conjecture.</p>

well known, inhabit the North
Eastern part of Siberia; their country is a small
tract of land, bounded on the North by the Frozen Sea,
on the East by the Eastern Ocean; on the South it borders
upon river Anadyr, and on that of Kovyma to the West.
The N. E. cape of this country is called Tschukotskoi-Noss,
or the promontory of the Tschutski. Its inhabitants
are the only people of Siberia who have not yet been
subdued by the Russians.</p>

<p>The anonymous author agrees with Mr. Muller in
supposing, that America advances to within a small distance
of the coast of the Tschutski; which he says "is
confirmed by the latest accounts procured from these
parts."</p>

<p>The first intelligence concerning the supposed vicinity
between Asia and America was derived from the reports<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
of the Tschutski in their intercourse with the Russians.
Vague and uncertain accounts, drawn from a barbarous
people, cannot deserve implicit credit; but as they have
been uniformly and invariably propagated by the inhabitants
of those regions from the middle of the last century
to the present time, they must merit at least the attention
of every curious enquirer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reports concerning the Proximity of America
to their Coast.</div><p>These reports were first related in
Muller's account of the Russian discoveries, and have been lately
thought worthy of notice by Dr. Robertson<a name="FNanchor_155_155"
id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>, in his history of
America. Their probability seems still further increased
by the following circumstances. One Plenisner, a native
of Courland, was appointed commander of Ochotsk,
in the year 1760, with an express order from the court
to proceed as far as<a name="FNanchor_156_156"
id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Anadirsk, and to procure all possible
intelligence concerning the North Eastern part of
Siberia, and the opposite continent. In consequence of
this order Plenisner repaired to Anadirsk, and proceeded
likewise to Kovimskoi Ostrog: the former of these Russian
settlements is situated near the Southern; the latter near
the Western limits of the Tschutski. Not content however
with collecting all the information in his power from
the neighbouring Koriacs, who have frequent intercourse<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
with the Tschutski; he also sent one Daurkin into their
country. This person was a native Tschutski, who
had been taken prisoner, and bred up by the Russians:
he continued two years with his countrymen, and made
several expeditions with them to the neighbouring islands,
which lie off the Eastern coast of Siberia.</p>

<p>The sum of the intelligence brought back by this
Daurkin was as follows: that Tschukotskoi-Noss is a
very narrow peninsula; that the Tschutski carry on a
trade of barter with the inhabitants of America; that
they employ six days in passing the strait which separates
the two continents: they direct their course from island
to island, and the distance from the one to the other is
so small, that they are able to pass every night ashore.
More to the North he describes the two continents as approaching
still nearer to each other, with only two islands
lying between them.</p>

<p>This intelligence remarkably coincided with the accounts
collected by Plenisner himself among the Koriacs.
Plenisner returned to Petersburg in 1776, and brought
with him several<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a
href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>maps and charts of
the North Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
parts of Siberia, which were afterwards made use of in
the compilation of the general map of Russia, published
by the academy in 1776<a name="FNanchor_158_158"
id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. By these means the country
of the Tschutski has been laid down with a greater degree
of accuracy than heretofore. These are probably
the late accounts from those parts which the anonymous
author alludes to.</p>

<i>Voyage of Lieutenant</i> Synd <i>to the North East of</i>
Siberia&mdash;<i>He discovers a cluster of islands, and a promontory,
which he supposes to belong to the continent of</i> America,
<i>lying near the coast of the</i> Tschutski.</h4>


<p>In 1764 lieutenant Synd sailed from Ochotsk, upon a
voyage of discovery towards the continent of America.
He was ordered to take a different course from that held
by the late Russian vessels, which lay due East from the
coast of Kamtchatka. As he steered therefore his course
more to the North East than any of the preceding navigators,
and as it appears from all the voyages related in
the first part of this work<a name="FNanchor_161_161"
id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>, that the vicinity of America
is to be sought for in that quarter alone, any accurate
account of this expedition would not fail of being highly
interesting. It is therefore a great mortification to me,
that, while I raise the reader's curiosity, I am not able
fully to satisfy it. The following intelligence concerning
this voyage is all which I was able to procure. It is
accompanied with an authentic chart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Chart</span> of <span class="smcap">Synd</span>'s
<i><span class="smcap">Voyage</span>
toward Tschukotskoi Noss</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1764 Synd put to sea from the port of Ochotsk, but
did not pass (we know not by what accident) the
southern Cape of Kamtchatka and Shushu, the first Kuril
Isle, before 1766. He then steered his course North at
no great distance from the coast of the Peninsula, but
made very little progress that year, for he wintered South
of the river Uka.</p>

<p>The following year he sailed from Ukinski Point due
East and North East, until he fell in with a cluster of
islands<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a
href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> stretching
between 61 and 62 degrees of latitude,
and 195&deg; and 202&deg; longitude. These islands lie South
East and East of the coast of the Tschutski; and several
of them are situated very near the shore. Besides these
small islands, he discovered also a mountainous coast
lying within one degree of the coast of the Tschutski,
between 64 and 66 North latitude; its most Western
extremity was situated in longitude 38&deg; 15&acute; from
Ochotsk, or 199&deg; 1&acute; from Fero. This island is laid
down in his chart as part of the continent of America;
but we cannot determine upon what proofs he
grounds this representation, until a more circumstantial
account of his voyage is communicated to the public.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a><br /><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>Synd
seems to have made but a short stay ashore. Instead
of endeavouring to survey its coasts, or of steering
more to the East, he almost instantly shaped his course
due West towards the course of the Tschutski, then
turned directly South and South West, until he came
opposite to Chatyrskoi Noss. From that point he continued
to coast the peninsula of Kamtchatka, doubled the
cape, and reached Ochotsk in 1768.</p>

<i>from the</i> Lena <i>to</i> Shelatskoi Noss.</h4>


<p>The only communication hitherto known between
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, or between Europe
and the East Indies, is made either by sailing round the
Cape of Good Hope, or by doubling Cape Horn. But as
both these navigations are very long and dangerous, the
great object of several late European voyages has been
turned towards the discovery of a North East or a North
West passage. As this work is entirely confined to the
Russian navigations, any disquisition concerning the
North West passage is totally foreign to the purpose; and
for the same reason in what relates to the North East, these
researches extend only to the attempts of the Russians for
the discovery of that passage.</p>

<p>The advocates for the North East passage have divided
that navigation into three principal parts; and by endeavouring
to shew that these three parts have been<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
passed at different times, they conclude from thence,
that the whole when taken collectively is practicable.</p>

<p>These three parts are, 1. from Archangel to the Lena;
2. from the Lena to Kamtchatka; 3. from Kamtchatka
to Japan. With respect to the latter, the connection
between the seas of Kamtchatka and Japan first appeared
from some Japanese vessels, which were wrecked
upon the coast of Kamtchatka in the beginning of this
century; and this communication has been unquestionably
proved from several voyages made by the Russians
from Kamtchatka to Japan<a name="FNanchor_163_163"
id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.</p>

<p>No one ever asserted that the first part from Archangel
to the Lena was ever performed in one voyage; but several
persons having advanced that this navigation has
been made by the Russians at different times, it becomes
necessary to examine the accounts of the Russian voyages
in those seas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyages from Archangel to the
Yenis&egrave;i.</div><p>In 1734 lieutenant Morovieff sailed
from Archangel toward the river Oby; and got no farther the first
year than the mouth of the Petchora. The next summer he
passed through the straits ef Weygatz into the sea of
Kara; and coasted along the Eastern side of that sea, as
high as latitude 72&deg; 30&acute;, but did not double the promontory
which separates the sea of Kara from the Bay of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Oby. In 1738, the lieutenants Malgyin and Skurakoff
doubled that promontory with great difficulty, and entered
the bay of Oby. During these expeditions the navigators
met with great dangers and impediments from
the ice. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to pass
from the bay of Oby to the Yenis&egrave;i, which was at last
effected, in 1738, by two vessels commanded by lieutenants
Offzin and Koskeleff. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Unsuccessful Attempt to pass from the
Yenis&egrave;i to the Lena.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> The same
year the pilot Feodor Menin sailed from the Yenis&egrave;i rowards
the Lena:he steered North as high as lat. 73&deg;. 15&acute;. and
when he came to the mouth of the Piasida he was stopped by the
ice; and finding it impossible to force a passage, he returned
to the Yenis&egrave;i<a name="FNanchor_164_164"
id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Prontshistsheff from the Lena towards
the Yenis&egrave;i.</div><p>July, 1735, lieutenant Prontshistsheff
sailed from Yakutsk up the Lena to its mouth, in order to pass
from thence by sea to the Yenis&egrave;i. The Western mouths
of the Lena were so choaked up with ice, that he was
obliged to pass through the most Easterly one; and was
prevented by contrary winds from getting out until the
13th of August. Having steered North West along the
islands which lie scattered before the mouths of the Lena,
he found himself in lat. 70&deg; 4&acute;. He saw much ice to
the North and North East; and observed ice-mountains
from twenty-four to sixty feet in height. He steered betwixt
the ice, which in no place left a free channel of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
greater breadth than an hundred or two hundred yards.
The vessel being much damaged, on the 1st of September
he ran up the mouth of the Olenek, which, according
to his estimation, lies in 72&deg; 30&acute;, near which place
he passed the winter<a name="FNanchor_165_165"
id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>.</p>

<p>He got out of the Olenek the beginning of August in
the following year; and arrived on the third at the mouth
of the Anabara, which he found to lie in lat. 73&deg; 1&acute;.
There he continued until the 10th, while some of the
crew went up the country in search of some mines. On
the 10th he proceeded on his voyage: before he reached
the mouth of the Chatanga he was so entirely surrounded
and hemmed in with ice, that it was not without great
difficulty and danger he was able to get loose. He then
observed a large field of ice stretching into the sea, on
which account he was obliged to continue near the shore,
and to run up the Chatanga. The mouth of this river
was in lat 74&deg; 9&acute;. From thence he bent his course mostly
Northward along the shore, until he reached the mouth
of the Taimura on the 18th. He then proceeded further,
and followed the coast towards the Piasida. Near
the shore were several small islands, between which and
the land the ice was immovably fixed. He then directed
his course toward the sea, in order to pass round the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
chain of islands. At first he found the sea more free
to the North of the islands, while he observed much ice
lying between them. He came at length to the last island,
situated in lat. 77&deg; 25&acute;. Between this island and the
shore, as well as on the other side of the island which lay
most to the North, the ice was firm and immovable. <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Prevented by a Chain of
Islands and the Ice from getting to the Yenis&egrave;i<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> He attempted however to steer
still more to the North; and
having advanced about six miles, he was prevented by
a thick fog from proceeding: this fog being dispersed,
he saw on each side, and before him, nothing but ice;
that towards the sea was not fixed; but the accumulated
masses were all so close, that the smallest vessel could not
have worked its way through. Still attempting however
to pass to the North; he was forced by the ice N. E.
Apprehensive of being hemmed in, he returned to the
Taimura; and from thence got, with much difficulty
and danger, to the Olenek, on the 29th of August.</p>

<p>This narrative of Prontshistsheff's expedition is
extracted from the account of professor<a name="FNanchor_166_166"
id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Gmelin: according
to Mr. Muller<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a
href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, who has given
a cursory relation of the same voyage, Prontshistsheff did not
quite reach the mouth of the Taimura; for he there found the chain of
islands stretching from the continent far into the sea.
The channels between the islands were so choaked up<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
with ice, that it was impossible to force a passage: after
steering as high as lat. 77&deg; 25&acute;, he found such a plain
of fixed ice before him, that he had no prospect of
getting any farther. Accordingly he returned to the Olenek.</p>

<p>Another attempt was made to pass from the Lena to
the Yenis&egrave;i in 1739, by Chariton Laptieff, with equal
bad success; and he relates, that between the rivers
Piasida and Taimura, a promontory stretches into the
sea which he could not double, the sea being entirely
frozen up before he could pass round<a name="FNanchor_168_168"
id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cape between the Rivers Chatanga and Piasida
never yet doubled.</div><p>From all these circumstances we must
collect, that the whole space between Archangel and the Lena has never
yet been navigated; for in going East from the Yenis&egrave;i
the Russians could get no farther than the mouth of the
Piasida; and, in coming West from the Lena, they were
stopped, according to Gmelin, North of the Piasida;
and, according to Muller, East of the Taimura.</p>

<p>The Russians, who sail almost annually from Archangel,
and other towns, to Nova Zemla, for the purpose
of catching sea-horses, seals, and white bears, make<span

passed round its North Eastern extremity<a name="FNanchor_169_169"
id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempts of the Russians to pass from the Lena

now remains to be considered. If we may believe some authors,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
this navigation has been open for above a century and
an half; and several vessels have at different times<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
passed round the North Eastern extremity of Asia. But
if we consult the Russian accounts, we shall find, that frequent
expeditions have been unquestionably made from
the Lena to the Kovyma; but that the voyage from the
Kovyma round Tschukotskoi Noss, into the Eastern ocean,
has been performed but once. According to Mr. Muller,
this formidable cape was doubled in the year 1648.
The material incidents of this remarkable voyage are as
follow.</p>

id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>, in order to penetrate into
the Eastern Ocean. Of these, four were never more
heard of: the remaining three were commanded by
Simon Deshneff, Gerasim Ankudinoff, two chiefs of the
Cossacs, and Fedot Alexeeff, the head of the Promyshlenics.
Deshneff and Ankudinoff quarrelled before their<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
departure: this dispute was owing to the jealousy of
Deshneff, who was unwilling that Ankudinoff should
share with him the honour, as well as the profits, which
might result from the expected discoveries. Each vessel
was probably manned with about thirty persons; Ankudinoff's,
we certainly know, carried that number.
Deshneff promised before-hand a tribute of seven fables,
to be exacted from the inhabitants on the banks of Anadyr;
so sanguine were his hopes of reaching that river.
This indeed he finally effected; but not so soon, nor with
so little difficulty, as he had presumed.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, 1648, the three vessels sailed
upon this remarkable expedition from the river Kovyma.
Considering the little knowledge we have of the extreme
regions of Asia, it is much to be regretted, that all the
incidents of this voyage are not circumstantially related.
Deshneff<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a
href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>, in an account of
his expedition sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315"
id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Yakutsk, seems only as it were accidentally to mention
his adventures by sea: he takes no notice of any occur<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>rence
until he reached the great promontory of the
Tschutski; no obstructions from the ice are mentioned,
and probably there were none; for he observes upon
another occasion, that the sea is not every year so free<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
from ice as it was at this time. He commences his narrative
with a description of the great promontory: "It
is," says he, "very different from that which is situated
West of the Kovyma, near the river Tschukotskia. It
lies between North and North East, and bends, in a
circular direction, towards the Anadyr. It is distinguished
on the Russian (namely, the Western) side, by
a rivulet which falls into the sea, close to which the
Tschutski have raised a pile, like a tower, with the
bones of whales. Opposite the promontory, (it is not
said on which side), are two islands, on which he observed
people of the nation of the Tschutski, who had
pieces of the sea-horse tooth thrust into holes made in
their lips. With a good wind it is possible to sail from
this promontory to the Anadyr in three days; and the
journey by land may be performed in the same space
of time, because the Anadyr falls into a bay." Ankudinoff's
kotche was wrecked on this promontory, and
the crew was distributed on board the two remaining
vessels. On the 20th of September Deshneff and Fedot
Alexeef went on shore, and had a skirmish with the
Tschutski, in which Alexeef was wounded. The two
vessels soon afterwards lost sight of each other, and never
again rejoined. Deshneff was driven about by tempestuous
winds until October, when he was shipwrecked
(as it appears from circumstances), considerably to the
South of the Anadyr, not far from the river Olutora.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
What became of Fedot Alexeff and his crew will be mentioned
hereafter. Deshneff and his companions, who
amounted to twenty-five persons, now sought for the
Anadyr; but being entirely unacquainted with the
country, ten weeks elapsed before they reached its banks
at a small distance from its mouth: here he found neither
wood nor inhabitants, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following year he went further up the river, and
built Anadirskoi Ostrog: here he was joined by some
Russians on the 25th of April, 1650, who came by land
from the river Kovyma. In 1652, Deshneff having
constructed a vessel, sailed down the Anadyr as far as
its mouth, and observed on the North side a sand bank,
which stretched a considerable way into the sea. A
sand bank of this kind is called, in Siberia, Korga. Great
numbers of sea-horses were found to resort to the
mouth of the Anadyr. Deshneff collected several of
their teeth, and thought himself amply compensated by
this acquisition for the trouble of his expedition. In
the following year, Deshneff ordered wood to be felled
for the purpose of constructing a vessel, in which he
proposed sending the tribute which he had collected by
sea to Yakutsk<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a
href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. But this design
was laid aside from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319"
id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
want of other materials. It was also reported, that the
sea about Tschukotskoi Noss was not every year free
from ice.</p>

<p>Another expedition was made in 1654 to the Korga,
for the purpose of collecting sea-horse teeth. A Cossac,
named Yusko Soliverstoff, was one of the party, the
same who had not long before accompanied the Cossac
Michael Stadukin, upon a voyage of discovery in the
Frozen Sea. This person was sent from Yakutsk to
collect sea-horse teeth, for the benefit of the crown. In
his instructions mention is made of the river Yentshendon,
which falls into the bay of Penshinsk, and of the
Anadyr; and he was ordered to exact a tribute from
the inhabitants dwelling near these rivers; for the adventures
of Deshneff were not as yet known at Yakutsk.
This was the occasion of new discontents. Soliverstoff
claimed to himself the discovery of the Korga, as if he
had sailed to that place in his voyage with Stadukin in
1649. Deshneff, however, proved that Soliverstoff had
not even reached Tschukotskoi Noss, which he describes
as nothing but bare rock, and it was but too well known
to him, because the vessel of Ankudinoff was ship-wrecked
there. "Tschukotskoi Noss," adds Deshneff,
"is not the first promontory which presents itself under
the name of Svatoi Noss<a name="FNanchor_173_173"
id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. It is known by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
two islands situated opposite to it, whose inhabitants
(as is before-mentioned) place pieces of the sea-horse
tush into holes made in their lips. Deshneff alone
had seen these people, which neither Stadukin nor
Soliverstoff had pretended to have done: and the
Korga, or sand-bank, at the mouth of the river Anadyr,
was at some distance from these islands."</p>

<p>While Deschneff was surveying the sea-coast, he saw
in an habitation belonging to some Koriacs a woman of
Yakutsk, who, as he recollected, belonged to Fedot
Alexieff. Upon his enquiry concerning the fate of her
master, she replied, "that Fedot and Gerasim (Ankudinoff)
had died of the scurvy; that part of the crew had
been slain; that a few had escaped in small vessels,
and have never since been heard off." Traces of the
latter were afterwards found in the peninsula of
Kamt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg
321]</a></span>chatka; to which place they probably arrived with a
favourite wind, by following the coast, and running up
the Kamtchatka river.</p>

<p>When Volodimir Atlassoff, in 1697, first entered upon
the reduction of Kamtchatka, he found that the inhabitants
had already some knowledge of the Russians. A
common tradition still prevails amongst them, that long
before the expedition of Atlassoff, one<a name="FNanchor_174_174"
id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Fedotoff (who
was probably the son of Fedot Alexeeff) and his companions
had resided amongst them, and had intermarried
with the natives. They still shew the spot where the
Russian habitations stood; namely, at the mouth of the small
river Nikul which falls into the Kamtchatka river, and is
called by the Russians Fedotika. Upon Atlassoff's arrival
none of the first Russians remained. They are said to
have been held in great veneration, and almost deified
by the inhabitants, who at first imagined that no human
power could hurt them, until they quarrelled amongst
themselves, and the blood was seen to flow from the
wounds which they gave each other: and upon a separation
taking place between the Russians, part of them had
been killed by the Koriacs, as they were going to the
sea of Penshinsk, and the remainder by the Kamtchadals.
The river Fedotika falls into the Southern side of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the Kamtchatka river about an hundred and eighty versts
below Upper Kamtchatkoi Ostrog. At the time of the
first expedition to Kamtchatka, in 1697, the remains of
two villages still subsisted, which had probably been inhabited
by Fedotoff and his companions: and no one
knew which way they came into the peninsula, until it
was discovered from the archives of Yakutsk in 1636.

</div>

<p>The following narrative of a late voyage performed
by one Shalauroff, from the Lena towards Tschukotskoi-Noss,
will shew the great impediments which obstruct a
coasting navigation in the Frozen Sea, even at the most
favourable season of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyage of Shalauroff.</div><p>Shalauroff, having
constructed a shitik at his own
expence, went down the Lena in 1761. He was accompanied
by an exiled midshipman, whom he had
found at Yakutsk, and to whom we are indebted for<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the chart of this expedition. Shalauroff got out of the
Southern mouth of the Lena in July, but was so much
embarrassed by the ice, that he ran the vessel into the
mouth of the Yana, where he was detained by the ice
until the 29th of August, when he again set sail. Being
prevented by the ice from keeping the open sea, he
coasted the shore; and, having doubled Svatoi-Noss on
the 6th of September, discovered at a small distance, out
at sea, to the North, a mountainous land, which is probably
some unknown island in the Frozen Sea. He was
employed from the 7th to the 15th in getting through
the strait between Diomed's island and the coast of
Siberia; which he effected, not without great difficulty.
From the 16th he had a free sea and a fair S. W. wind,
which carried them in 24 hours beyond the mouth of the
Indigirka. The favourable breeze continuing, he passed
on the 18th the Alasca. Soon afterwards, the vessel
approaching too near the shore was entangled amongst
vast floating masses of ice, between some islands<a
name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a
href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the main land. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Winters
at the Mouth of the Kovyma.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> And now
the late season of the year obliged Shalauroff to look out for a
wintering place; he accordingly ran the vessel into one of the mouths
of the river Kovyma, where she was laid up. The crew
immediately constructed an hut, which they secured
with a rampart of frozen snow, and a battery of the
small guns. The wild rein-deers resorted to this place
in large herds, and were shot in great plenty from the
enclosure. Before the setting in of winter, various species
of salmon and trout came up the river in shoals:
these fish afforded the crew a plentiful subsistence, and
preserved them from the scurvy<a name="FNanchor_178_178"
id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure from thence in July.</div><p>The
mouth of the Kovyma was not freed from ice
before the 21st of July, 1762, when Shalauroff again<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
put to sea, and steered until the 28th N. E. by N. E.
1/4 E. Here he observed the variation of the compass
ashore, and found it to be 11&deg; 15&acute;&acute; East. The 28th a
contrary wind, which was followed by a calm, obliged
him to come to an anchor, and kept him stationary
until the 10th of August, when a favourable breeze
springing up he set sail; he then endeavoured to steer
at some distance from shore, holding a more Easterly
course, and N. E. by E. But the vessel was impeded by
large bodies of floating ice, and a strong current, which
seemed to bear Westward at the rate of a verst an hour.
These circumstances very much retarded his course. On
the 18th, the weather being thick and foggy, he found
himself unexpectedly near the coast with a number of
ice islands before him, which on the 19th entirely surrounded
and hemmed in the vessel. He continued in
that situation, and in a continual fog, until the 23d,
when he got clear, and endeavoured by steering N. E.
to regain the open sea, which was much less clogged
with ice than near the shore. He was forced however,
by contrary winds, S. E. and E. among large
masses of floating ice. This drift of ice being passed,
he again stood to the N. E. in order to double Shelatskoi
Noss<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a
href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>; but before he
could reach the islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
lying near it, he was so retarded by contrary winds,
that he was obliged, on account of the advanced season,
to search for a wintering place. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Not being able to double Shelatskoi Noss
returns towards the Kovyma.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> He
accordingly sailed South towards an open bay, which lies on the
West side of Shelatskoi Noss, and which no navigator
had explored before him. He steered into it on the
25th, and got upon a shoal between a small island,
and a point of land which juts from the Eastern
coast of this bay. Having got clear with much difficulty,
he continued for a short time a S. E. course,
then turned S. W. He then landed in order to discover
a spot proper for their winter residence; and found two
small rivulets, but neither trees nor drift wood. The
vessel was towed along the Southerly side of the bay as
far as the island Sabad&egrave;i. On the 5th of September, he
saw some huts of the Tschutski close to the narrow
channel between Sabad&egrave;i and the main land; but the
inhabitants fled on his approach.</p>

<p>Not having met with a proper situation, he stood
out to sea, and got round the island Sabad&egrave;i on the
8th, when he fastened the vessel to a large body of ice,
and was carried along by a current towards W. S. W.
at the rate of five versts an hour. On the 10th, he
saw far to the N. E. by N. a mountain, and steered the
11th and 12th towards his former wintering place in
the river Kovyma. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Winters
a second Time at the Kovyma, and returns to the Lena.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span> Shalauroff proposed to
have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the following year another attempt to double Shelatskoi
Noss; but want of provision, and the mutiny of the
crew, forced him to return to the Lena in 1763. It
is worth remarking, that during his whole voyage he
found the currents setting in almost uniformly from
the East. Two remarkable rocks were observed by
Shalauroff near the point where the coast turns to
the N. E. towards the channel which separates the
island Sabad&egrave;i from the continent; these rocks may
serve to direct future navigators: one is called Saetshie
Kamen, or Hare's Rock, and rises like a crooked horn;
the other Baran&egrave;i Kamen, or Sheep's Rock; it is in
the shape of a pear, narrower at the bottom than at top,
and rises twenty-nine yards above high-water mark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second Expedition of Shalauroff.</div><p>Shalauroff,
who concluded from his own experience,
that the attempt to double Tschukotskoi Noss, though
difficult, was by no means impracticable, was not discouraged
by his former want of success from engaging
a second time in the same enterprize: he accordingly
fitted out the same shitik, and in 1764 departed as before
from the river Lena. We have no positive accounts
of this second voyage; for neither Shalauroff or
any of his crew have ever returned. The following
circumstances lead us to conclude, that both he and
his crew were killed near the Anadyr by the Tschutski,
about the third year after their departure from the Lena.<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
About that time the Koriacs of the Anadyr refused to
take from the Russians the provision of flour, which
they are accustomed to purchase every year. Enquiry
being made by the governor of Anadirsk, he found that
they had been amply supplied with that commodity
by the Tschutski. The latter had procured it from the
plunder of Shalauroff's vessel, the crew of which appeared
to have perished near the Anadyr. <span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>No Account of this Expedition, he and his
Crew being killed by the Tschutski.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
From these facts, which have been since confirmed by repeated
intelligence from the Koriacs and Tschutski, it has been asserted,
that Shalauroff had doubled the N. E. cape of
Asia. But this assertion amounts only to conjecture; for
the arrival of the crew at the mouth of the Anadyr
affords no decisive proof that they had passed round the
Eastern extremity of Asia; for they might have penetrated
to that river by land, from the Western side of Tschukotskoi-Noss.</p>

<p>In reviewing these several accounts of the Russian
voyages in the Frozen Sea, as far as they relate to
a North East passage, we may observe, that the cape
which stretches to the North of the Piasida has never
been doubled; and that the existence of a passage round
Tschukotskoi Noss rests upon the single authority of
Deshneff. Admitting however a practicable navigation
round these two promontories, yet when we consider
the difficulties and dangers which the Russians
en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>countered in those parts of the Frozen Sea which they
have unquestionably sailed through; how much time
they employed in making an inconsiderable progress, and
how often their attempts were unsuccessful: when we
reflect at the same time, that these voyages can only be
performed in the midst of a short summer, and even
then only when particular winds drive the ice into the
sea, and leave the shores less obstructed; we shall reasonably
conclude, that a navigation, pursued along the
coasts in the Frozen Ocean, would probably be useless for
commercial purposes.</p>

<p>A navigation therefore in the Frozen Ocean, calculated
to answer any end of general utility, must (if possible) be
made in an higher latitude, at some distance from the
shores of Nova Zemla and Siberia. And should we
even grant the possibility of sailing N. E. and East of
Nova Zemla, without meeting with any insurmountable
obstacles from land or ice; yet the final completion
of a N. E. voyage must depend upon the existence of a free
passage<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a
href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> between the coast
of the Tschutski and the continent of America. But such
dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg

this work, which is meant to state and examine facts,

<div class="sidenote">Tartarian, or Turkey, Rhubarb.</div><p>Europe
is supplied with rhubarb from Russia and
the East Indies. The former is generally known by
the name of Turkey rhubarb, because we used to import
it from the Levant in our commerce with the Turks,
who procured it through Persia from the Bucharians.
And it still retains its original name, although instead of
being carried, as before, to Constantinople, it is now
brought to Kiachta by the Bucharian merchants, and
there disposed of to the Russians. This appellation is
indeed the most general; but it is mentioned occasionally
by several authors, under the different denominations of
Russian, Tartarian, Bucharian, and Thibet, Rhubarb.
This sort is exported from Russia in large roundish
pieces, freed from the bark, with an hole through the
middle: they are externally of a yellow colour, and
when cut appear variagated with lively reddish streaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Indian Rhubarb.</div><p>The other sort is
called by the Druggists Indian Rhubarb;
and is procured from Canton in longer, harder,
heavier, more compact pieces, than the former; it is
more astringent, and has somewhat less of an aromatic
flavour; but, on account of its cheapness, is more generally
used than the Tartarian or Turkey Rhubarb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tartarian Rhubarb procured at
Kiachta.</div><p>The government of Russia has reserved to itself the
exclusive privilege of purchasing rhubarb; it is
brought to Kiachta by some Bucharian merchants, who
have entered into a contract to supply the crown with
that drug in exchange for furs. These merchants come
from the town of Selin, which lies South Westward of
the Koko-Nor, or Blue Lake toward Thibet. Selin, and
all the towns of Little Bucharia; viz. Kashkar, Yerken,
Atrar, &amp;c. are subject to China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rhubarb Plant grows upon the Mountains
of Little Bucharia.</div><p>The best rhubarb purchased at Kiachta
is produced upon a chain of rocks, which are very high, and for the
most part destitute of wood: they lie North of Selin, and
stretch as far as the Koko-Nor. The good roots are
distinguished by large and thick stems. The Tanguts,
who are employed in digging up the roots, enter upon
that business in April or May. As fast as they take them
out of the earth, they cleanse them from the soil, and
hang them upon the neighbouring trees to dry, where<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
they remain until a sufficient quantity is procured: after
which they are delivered to the Bucharian merchants.
The roots are wrapped up in woollen sacks, carefully
preserved from the least humidity; and are in this manner
transported to Kiachta upon camels.</p>

<p>The exportation of the best rhubarb is prohibited by
the Chinese, under the severest penalties. It is procured
however in sufficient quantities, sometimes by clandestinely
mixing it with inferior roots, and sometimes by
means of a contraband trade. The College of Commerce
at Petersburg is solely empowered to receive this
drug, and appoints agents at Kiachta for that purpose.
Much care is taken in the choice; for it is examined, in
the presence of the Bucharian merchants, by an apothecary
commissioned by government, and resident at Kiachta.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Care taken in examining
the roots at Kiachta.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> All the
worm-eaten roots are rejected; the remainder
are bored through, in order to ascertain their soundness;
and all the parts which appear in the least damaged
or decayed are cut away. By these means even
the best roots are diminished a sixth part; and the refuse
is burnt, in order to prevent its being brought another
year<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a

of these several species is the true rhubarb; and that
question does not appear to be as yet satisfactorily cleared
up. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Rheum
Palmatum.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> However, according to
the notion which is most generally received, it is supposed to be
the Rheum<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a
href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Palmatum;
the seeds of which were originally procured
from a Bucharian merchant, and distributed to the principal
botanists of Europe. Hence this plant has been
cultivated with great success; and is now very common
in all our botanical gardens. The learned doctor<a
name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>Hope,
professor of medicine and botany in the university of
Edinburgh, having made trials of the powder of this root,
in the same doses in which the foreign rhubarb is given,
found no difference in its effects; and from thence conclusions
have been drawn with great appearance of
pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg
336]</a></span>bability, that this is the plant which produces the true
rhubarb. But this inference does not appear to be absolutely
conclusive; for the same trials have been repeated,
and with similar success, upon the roots of the
R. Rhaponticum and R. Rhabarbarum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">R. Rhaponticum.</div><p>The leaves of the
R. Rhaponticum are round, and
sometimes broader than they are long. This species is
found abundantly in the loamy and dry deserts between
the Volga and the Yaik<a name="FNanchor_186_186"
id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>, towards the Caspian Sea. It
was probably from this sort that the name Rha, which is
the Tartarian appellation of the river Volga, was first applied
by the Arabian physicians to the several species of
rheum. The roots however which grow in these warm
plains are rather too astringent; and therefore ought not
to be used in cases where opening medicines are required.
The Calmucs call it Badshona, or a stomachic. The
young shoots of this plant, which appear in March or
April, are deemed a good antiscorbutic; and are used as
such by the Russians. The R. Rhaponticum is not to be
found to the West of the Volga. The seeds of this
species produced at Petersburg plants of a much greater
size than the wild ones: the leaves were large, and of a
roundish cordated figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">R. Rhabarbarum.</div><p>The R. Rhabarbarum grows
in the crevices of bare
rocky mountains, and also upon gravelly soils: it is
more particularly found in the high vallies of the romantic
country situated beyond Lake Baikal. Its buds do
not shoot before the end of April; and it continues in
flower during the whole month of May. The stalks of
the leaves are eaten raw by the Tartars: they produce
upon most persons, who are unaccustomed to them, a
kind of sphasmodic contraction of the throat, which goes
off in a few hours; it returns however at every meal,
until they become habituated to this kind of diet. The
Russians make use of the leaves in their hodge-podge:
accordingly, soups of this sort affect strangers in the manner
above mentioned. In Siberia the stalk is sometimes
preserved as a sweet-meat; and a custom prevails among
the Germans of introducing at their tables the buds of
this plant, as well as of the Rheum Palmatum, instead of
cauli-flower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">R. Rhaponticum.</div><p>The R. Rhaponticum
which commonly grows near
the torrents has, as well as the R. Rhabarbarum of Siberia,
the upper part of its roots commonly rotten, from
too much moisture: accordingly, a very small portion of
the lower extremity is fit for use. The Russian College
of Physicians order, for the use of their military hospitals,
large quantities of these roots to be dug up in
Siberia, which are prescribed under the name of rhapontic.
But the persons employed in digging and preparing
it are so ill instructed for that purpose, that its<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
best juices are frequently lost. These roots ought to be
drawn up in spring, soon after the melting of the snows,
when the plant retains all its sap and strength; whereas
they are not taken out of the ground before August,
when they are wasted by the increase of the stem, and
the expansion of the leaves. Add to this, that the roots
are no sooner taken up, than they are immediately sliced
in small pieces, and thus dried: by which means the
medicinal qualities are sensibly impaired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Method of drying the Roots of the R.
Rhaponticum.</div><p>For the same roots, which in this instance were
of such little efficacy, when dried with proper precaution,
have been found to yield a very excellent rhubarb. The
process observed for this purpose, by the ingenious Mr.
Pallas, was as follows: The roots, immediately after
being drawn out, were suspended over a stove, where
being gradually dried, they were cleansed from the
earth: by these means, although they were actually
taken up in autumn, they so nearly resembled the best
Tartarian rhubarb in colour, texture, and purgative qualities,
that they answered, in every respect, the same
medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>A German apothecary, named Zuchert, made similar
trials with the same success, both on the Rheum Rhabarbarum
and R. Rhaponticum, which grow in great
perfection on the mountains in the neighbourhood of
Nershinsk. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Plantation
of Rhubarb in Siberia.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> He formed
plantations of these herbs on<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the declivity of a rock<a name="FNanchor_187_187"
id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>, covered with one foot of good
mould, mixed with an equal quantity of sand and gravel.
If the summer proved dry, the plants were left in the
ground; but if the season was rainy, after drawing
out the roots he left them for some days in the shade
to dry, and then replanted them. By this method of
cultivation he produced in seven or eight years very large
and sound roots, which the rock had prevented from penetrating
too deep; and when they were properly dried,
one scruple was as efficacious as half a drachm of Tartarian
rhubarb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Roots of the R. Rhaponticum and R.
Rhubarbarum, equal in their Effects to the Tartarian
Rhubarb.</div><p>From the foregoing observations it follows, that
there are other plants, besides the Rheum Palmatum, the roots
whereof have been found to be similar both in their appearance
and effects, to what is called the best rhubarb.
And indeed, upon enquiries made at Kiachta concerning
the form and leaves of the plant which produces that
drug, it seems not to be the R. Palmatum, but a species
with roundish scolloped leaves, and most probably the
R. Rhaponticum: for Mr. Pallas, when he was at Kiachta,
applied for information to a Bucharian merchant of
Selin-Chotton, who now supplies the crown with
rhu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg
340]</a></span>barb; and his description of that plant answered to the
figure of the Rheum Rhaponticum. The truth of this
description was still further confirmed by some Mongol
travellers who had been in the neighbourhood of the
Koko-Nor and Thibet; and had observed the rhubarb
growing wild upon those mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The true Rhubarb probably procured from
different Species of Rheum.</div><p>The experiments also made by
Zuchert and others, upon the roots of the R. Rhabarbarum and R.
Rhaponticum, sufficiently prove, that this valuable drug was
procured from those roots in great perfection.
the seeds of the Rheum Palmatum were received from
the father of the above-mentioned Bucharian merchant
as taken from the plant which furnishes the true rhubarb,
we have reason to conjecture, that these three
species, viz. R. Palmatum, R. Rhaponticum, and R. Rhabarbarum,
when found in a dryer and milder alpine
climate, and in proper situations, are indiscriminately
drawn up; whenever the size of the plant seems to promise
a fine root. And perhaps the remarkable difference
of the rhubarb, imported to Kiachta, is occasioned by this
indiscriminate method of collecting them. Most certain
it is, that these plants grow wild upon the mountains,
without the least cultivation; and those are esteemed the
best which are found near the Koko-Nor, and about the
sources of the river Koango.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>
<p>Formerly the exportation of rhubarb was confined to
the crown of Russia; and no persons but those employed
by government were allowed the permission of
sending it to foreign countries; this monopoly however
has been taken off by the present empress, and the free
exportation of it from St. Petersburg granted to all persons
upon paying the duty. It is sold in the first instance by the
College of Commerce for the profit of the Sovereign;
and is preserved in their magazines at St. Petersburg.
The current price is settled every year by the College
of Commerce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Price of Rhubarb in Russia.</div><p>It is
received from the Bucharian merchants at Kiachta
in exchange for furs; and the prime cost is rated at
16 roubles per pood. By adding the pay of the commissioners
who purchase it, and of the apothecary who
examines it, and allowing for other necessary expences,
the value of a pood at Kiachta amounts to 25 roubles;
add to this the carriage from the frontiers to St. Petersburg,
and it is calculated that the price of a pood stands
the crown at 30 roubles. The largest exportation of
rhubarb ever known from Russia, was made in the year
1765, when 1350 pood were exported, at 65 roubles
per pood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superiority of the Tartarian over the Indian
Rhubarb.</div><p>The superiority of this Tartarian Rhubarb, over that
procured from Canton, arises probably from the following
circumstances.</p>

<p>1. The Southern parts of China are not so proper for
the growth of this plant, as the mountains of Little
Bucharia.</p>

<p>2. There is not so exact an examination made in
receiving it from the Chinese at Canton, as from the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Bucharians at Kiachta. For the merchants, who purchase
this drug at Canton, are obliged to accept it in the
gross, without separating the bad roots, and cutting
away the decayed parts, as is done at Kiachta.</p>

<p>3. It is also probable, that the long transport of this
drug by sea is detrimental to it, from the humidity
which it must necessarily contract during so long a
voyage.</p>

by orders of the crown, before he undertook the voyage mentioned
in the text.</p>

<p>In 1728, he departed from the mouth of the Kamtchatka river, in
company with Tschirikoff. The purport of this voyage was to ascertain,
whether the two Continents of Asia and America were separated;
and Peter I. a short time before his death, had drawn up instructions
with his own hand for that purpose. Beering coasted the Eastern shore
of Siberia as high as latitude 67&deg; 18&acute;; but made no discovery of the

<p>In 1741, Beering and Tschirikoff went out upon the celebrated
expedition (alluded to in the text, and which is so often mentioned
in the course of this work) towards the coasts of America. This

authors have supposed the name of Siberia to derive its
origin from this fortress, soon after it was first taken by the Russians
under Yermac. But this opinion is advanced without sufficient foundation;
for the name of Sibir was unknown to the Tartars, that fort being
by them called Isker. Besides, the Southern part of the province of
Tobolsk, to which the name of Siberia was originally applied, was thus
denominated by the Russians before the invasion of Yermac. This
denomination probably first came from the Permians and Sirjanians,
who brought the first accounts of Siberia to the Russians.</p>

transmitted to writing; and these papers are the archives of

<p>The Manshurs were originally an obscure tribe of the Tungusian
Tartars, whose territories lay South of the Amoor, and bordered upon
the kingdom of Corea, and the province of Leaotong. They began to emerge
from obscurity at the beginning of the seventeenth century. About that
time their chief Aischin-Giord reduced several neighbouring hordes;
and, having incorporated them with his own tribe, under the general
name of Manshur, he became formidable even to the Chinese. Shuntschi,
grandson of this chief, by an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances,
was raised while an infant to the throne of China, of which his
successors still continue in possession. Shuntschi died in 1662, and
was succeeded by Camhi, who is well known from the accounts of the
jesuit missionaries.</p>

two Gorbitzas; the first falls into the Amoor, near the
conflux of the Argoon and Shilka; the second falls into the Shilka. The
former was meant by the Russians; but the Chinese fixed upon the latter
for the boundary, and have carried their point. Accordingly the present
limits are somewhat different from those mentioned in the text. They
are carried from the point, where the Shilka and Argoon unite to form
the Amoor, Westward along the Shilka, until they reach the mouth of
tha Western Gorbitza; from thence they are continued to the source of
the last-mentioned river, and along the chain of mountains as before. By
this alteration the Russian limits are somewhat abridged.</p></div>

first Russian church at Pekin was built for the accommodation
of the Russians taken prisoners at Albasin. These persons were carried
to Pekin, and the place appointed for their habitation in that city was
called the Russian Street, a name it still retains. They were so
well received by the Chinese, that, upon the conclusion of the treaty
of Nershinsk, they refused to return to their native country. And as
they intermarried with the Chinese women, their descendants are
quite naturalized; and have for the most part adopted not only
the language, but even the religion of the Chinese. Hence, the
above-mentioned church, though it still exists, is no longer applied
to the purpose of divine worship: its priest was transferred to
the church, which was built within the walls of the caravansary.</p></div>

This account of Kiachta and Maimatschin is taken from Mr. Pallas's
description of Kiachta, in the journal of his travels through Siberia,
p. iii. p. 109-126. Every circumstance relating to the religious worship
of the Eastern nations is, in itself so interesting that I thought
it would not be unacceptable to my readers to give a translation of
the above passages respecting the Chinese Pagodas and Idols: although
in a work treating of the new discoveries, and the commerce which
is connected with them. In the abovementioned journal the
ingenious author continues to describe from his own observations
the manners, customs, dress, diet, and several other particulars
relative to the Chinese; which, although exceedingly curious
and interesting, are foreign to my present purpose, and would have
been incompatible with the size of the present work. No writer
has placed the religion and history of the Tartar-nations in a
more explicit point of view than Mr. Pallas; every page in
his interesting journal affords striking proofs of this assertion.
He has lately thrown new lights upon this obscure subject, in a
recent publication concerning the Tartars, who inhabit parts of
Siberia, and the territory
which lies between that country and the Chinese-wall. Of this excellent
work the first volume appeared in 1776, and contains the genealogy,
history, laws, manners, and customs, of this extraordinary people, as
they are divided into Calmucs, Mongols, and Burats. The second
volume is expected with impatience, and will ascertain, with minuteness
and accuracy, the tenets and religious ceremonies which distinguish the
votaries of Shamanism from the followers of Dalai-Lama, the two
great sects into which these tribes are distinguished. Pallas Samlung

Chinese have no gold or silver coin. These metals are always
paid in bullion; and for the purpose of ascertaining the weight, every
Chinese merchant is constantly provided with a pair of scales. As
gold is very scarce in China, silver is the great vehicle of commerce.
When several authors affirm that the Russians draw large quantities of
silver from China, they mistake an accidental occurrence for a general
and standing fact. During the war between the Chinese and Calmucs,
the former had occasion to purchase at Kiachta provision, horses,
and camels, for which they paid silver. This traffic brought
such a profusion of that metal into Siberia, that its price was
greatly reduced below its real value. A pound of silver was at
that period occasionally sold at the frontiers for 8 or 9 roubles, which
at present fetches 15 or 16. But since the conclusion of these wars by
the total reduction of the Calmucs under the Chinese yoke, Russia
receives a very small quantity of silver from the Chinese. S.R.G. III.
p. 593 &amp; seq.</p>

<p>
The silver imported to Kiachta is chiefly brought by the Bucharian
merchants, who sell cattle to the Chinese in exchange for that
metal, which they afterwards dispose of to the Russians for European
manufactures. Gold-dust is also occasionally obtained from the same
merchants; the quantity however of those metals procured at
Kiachta is so inconsiderable, as scarcely to deserve mention. The
whole sum imported to Kiachta, in 1777, amounted to only 18,215
roubles.</p></div>

year 1770, 1771, 1772, the custom-house duties at Kiachta
(according to Mr. Pallas, P. III. p. 154.) produced 550,000 roubles.
By taking therefore the medium between that sum and 481,460, the
amount of the duties in 1777, the average sum of the duties will be
515,730; and, as the duties in 1777 make nearly a sixth of the whole
sum of exportation and importation, by multiplying 515,730 by 6, we
have the gross amount of the average exports and imports at 3,094,380.
But as several goods pay no duty, and as the contraband trade according
to the lowest valuation is estimated at the fifth part of the exports
and imports; the gross amount of the average trade to China may be
fairly computed at near 4,000,000, the sum stated above.</p></div>

compared his observations with corresponding ones
taken at Petersburg, which gave results as follow:</p>

<p>From comparing an observation of an eclipse of the first satellite,
taken at Ochotsk the 17th of January, 1743, with an observation of an
eclipse of the same satellite taken at Petersburg on the 15th of January
in the same year, the difference of longitude between Petersburg and
Ochotsk appeared to be 7<sup>h</sup>. 31&acute; 29&acute;&acute;; from a comparison of two other
similar observations the difference of longitude was 7<sup>h</sup>.
31&acute; 3&acute;&acute;, a mean of which is 7<sup>h</sup>. 31&acute;
34&acute;&acute;, being the true difference between the meridians
of Petersburg and Ochotsk according to these observations. By adding
the difference of the longitude between Petersburg and Paris, which is
1<sup>h</sup>. 52&acute; 25&acute;&acute;, we have the longitude of
Ochotsk from Paris 9<sup>h</sup>. 23&acute; 59&acute;&acute;,
which differs 29&acute;&acute; only from the result of Mons. Maraldi.
Nov. Comm. Pet. III. p. 470. In the same manner the longitude of
Bolcheresk appears from the corresponding
observations taken at that place and at Petersburg to be
10h. 20&acute; 22&acute;&acute; differing from Mr. Maraldi about
2&acute; 5&acute;&acute;. Nov. Com. p. 469.</p>

<p>But the longitude of the port of St. Peter and Paul, estimated in the
same manner from corresponding observations, differs from the longitude
as computed by Mons. Maraldi no more than 20 seconds, p. 469.</p></div>

According to Mr. Pallas, the plants of the new-discovered islands
are mostly alpine, like those of Siberia; this he attributes to the
shortness and coldness of the summer, occasioned by the frequency of
the North winds. His words are: "Quoique les hivres de ces isles soient
assez temper&eacute;s par l'air de la mer, de fa&ccedil;on que les
neiges ne couvrent jamais la terre que par intervalles, la plupart des
plantes y sont alpines, comme en Siberie, par la raison que l'et&eacute; y est tout aussi courte et froide,
a cause des vents de nord qui y regnent." This passage is taken from a
MS treatise in the French language, relative to the new-discovered
islands communicated to me by my very learned and ingenious friend Mr.
Pallas, professor of natural history at St. Petersburg; from which I
have been enabled to collect a considerable degree of information.
This treatise was sent to Mons. Buffon; and that celebrated naturalist
has made great use of it in the fifth volume of his Supplement &agrave; l'Histoire Naturelle.</p></div>

Mr. Muller has long ago acknowledged, in the most candid and
public manner, the incorrectness of the former chart, as far as it
relates to the part which represents America, as contiguous to
Kamtchatka: but he still maintains his opinion concerning the actual
vicinity of the two continents in an higher latitude. The following
quotation is taken from a letter written by Mr. Muller, in 1774, of
which I have a copy in my possession. "Posterity must judge if the new
chart of the Academy is to be preferred to the former one for removing
the continent of America (which is represented as lying near the coast
of Tschutski) to a greater distance. Synd, who is more to be trusted
than the Promyschlenics, persists in the old system. He places America
as near as before to Tschukotskoi Noss, but knows nothing of a
large island called Alashka, which takes up the place of the continent,
and which ought to be laid down much more to the South or
South East."</p></div>

Olotorian Isles are so named from the small river of Olotora,
which flows into the sea at Kamtchatka, about latitude 61&deg;. The
following remarks upon this group of islands are taken from a letter of
Mr. Muller mentioned in the last note. "This appellation of Olutorian
Isles is not in use at Kamtchatka. These islands, called upon
this chart Olutorians, lie according to the chart of the Promyschlenics,
and the chart of the Academy, very remote from the river Olutora:
and it seems as if they were advanced upon this chart nearer
to Kamtchatka only in favour of the name. They cannot be situated
so near that coast, because they were neither seen by Beering
in 1728, nor by the Promyschlenics, Novikoff and Bacchoff, when
they sailed in 1748 from the Anadyr to Beering's Island." See p. 42.</p></div>

twelfth chapter of this Essay relates to the discoveries and
commerce of the Russians in the Eastern Ocean. The account of the
Russian discoveries is a translation of Mr. St&aelig;hlin's Description
of the New Northern Archipelago. In addition, he has subjoined an
account of Kamtchatka, and a short sketch of the Russian commerce to
the New Discovered Islands, and to America. If we may believe the
author of this Essay, the Russians have not only discovered America,
but they also every year form occasional settlements upon that
continent, similar to those of the Europeans in Newfoundland. His
words are: "Il est donc certain, que les Russes ont d&egrave;couvert
le continent de l'Am&eacute;rique; mais on peut assurer qu'ils n'y ont
encore aucun port, aucun comptoir. Il en est des &eacute;tablissements
de cette nation dans la grande terre, comme de ceux des nations
Europ&eacute;ennes dans l'isle de Terre Neve. Ses vaisseaux
ou fr&eacute;gates arrivent en Am&egrave;rique; leurs equipages et les
Cosaques chasseurs s'etablissent sur la c&ocirc;te; les uns se
retranchent, et les autres y font la chasse et la p&ecirc;che du chien
marin et du narval. Ils reviennent ensuite au Kamtchatka, apr&egrave;s
avoir &eacute;t&eacute; relev&egrave;s par d'autres fr&eacute;gates
sur les m&ecirc;mes parages, ou &agrave; des distances plus ou moins
eloign&eacute;s, &amp;c. &amp;c." See Essai sur le commerce de la
Russie, p. 292-293. Thus the publick is imposed upon by fictitious and
exaggerated accounts.</p></div>

this work is confined to the Russian Discoveries, yet as
the N. E. passage is a subject of such interesting curiosity, it might
seem
an omission in not mentioning, that several English and Dutch vessels
have passed through the Straits of Weygatz into the sea of Kara; they
all met with great obstructions from the ice, and had much difficulty in
getting through. See Histoire Gen. Des Voyages, tome XV. passim.</p>

<p>In 1696 Heemskirk and Barentz, after having sailed along the Western
coast of Nova Zemla, doubled the North Eastern cape lying in latitude
77&deg; 20, and got no lower along the Eastern coast than 76&deg;,
where they wintered.</p>

<p>See an account of this remarkable voyage in Girard Le Ver's Vraye
Description De Trois Voyages De Mer, p. 13 to 45; and Hist. Gen.
des Voy. tom. XV. p. 111 to 139.</p>

<p>No vessel of any nation has ever passed round that Cape, which
extends to the North of the Piasida, and is laid down in the Russian
charts in about 78&deg; latitude. We have already seen that no Russian
vessel has ever got from the Piasida to the Chatanga, or from the
Chatanga to the Piasida; and yet some authors have positively asserted, that this promontory
has been sailed round. In order therefore to elude the Russian accounts,
which clearly assert the contrary, it is pretended, that Gmelin
and Muller have purposely concealed some parts of the Russian journals,
and have imposed upon the world by a misrepresentation of facts. But
without entering into any dispute on this head, I can venture to affirm,
that no sufficient proof has been as yet advanced in support of this
assertion; and therefore until some positive information shall be
produced, we cannot deny plain facts, or give the preference to
hearsay evidence over circumstantial and well attested accounts.</p>

<p>Mr. Engel has a remarkable passage in his Essai sur une route par la
Nord Est, which it may be proper to consider in this place, because
he asserts in the most positive manner, that two Dutch vessels formerly
passed three hundred leagues to the North East of Nova Zemla; from
thence he infers that they must have doubled the above-mentioned Cape,
which extends to the North of the Piasida, and have got at least as far
East as the mouth of the Olenek. His words are L'Illustre Societ&eacute; Royale,
sous l'an 1675, rapporte ce voyage et dit, que peu d'ann&eacute;es
auparavant une Societ&eacute; de merchands d'Amsterdam avoit fait une
tentative pour chercher le passage du Nord Est, et &eacute;quippa deux
vaisseaux les quels etant pass&eacute; au septante neuf ou huitantieme
degr&egrave; de latitude, avoient pouss&egrave; selon Wood, jusqu'
&agrave; trois cent lieues &agrave; l'Est de la Nouvelle Zemble, &amp;c.
&amp;c. Upon this fact he founds his proof that the navigation from
Archangel to the Lena has been performed. Par consequent cette partie
de la route a &egrave;t&eacute; faite. He rests the truth of this
account on the authority of the Philosophical Transactions, and of
Captain Wood, who sailed upon a
voyage for the discovery of the North East passage in 1676. The latter,
in the relation of his voyage, enumerates several arguments which
induced him to believe the practicability of the North East
passage.&mdash;"The seventh argument," he says, "was another narration,
printed in the Transactions, of two ships of late that had attempted
the passage, sailed 300 leagues to the Eastward of Nova Zemla, and had
after prosecuted the voyage, had there not a difference arose betwixt
the undertakers and the East-India company." We here find that Captain
Wood refers to the Philosophical Transactions for his authority. The
narration printed in the Transactions, and which is alluded to by both
Captain Wood and Mr. Engel, is to be found in Vol. IX. of the
Philosophical Transactions, p. 209, for December, 1674. It consists of
a very curious "Narrative of some observations made upon several
voyages, undertaken to find a way for sailing about the North to the
East-Indies; together with instructions given by the Dutch East-India
Company for the discovery of the famous land of Jesso near Japan."
These instructions were, in 1643, given to Martin Geritses Vries,
captain of the ship Castricum, "who set out to discover the unknown
Eastern coast of Tartary, the kingdom of Catay, and the West coast of
America, together with the isles situate to the East of Japan, cried up for their
riches of gold and silver." These instructions contain no relation of
two Dutch vessels, who passed 300 leagues East of Nova Zemla.
Mention is made of two Dutch vessels, "who were sent out in the
year 1639, under the command of Captain Kwast, to discover the
East coast of the Great Tartary, especially the famous gold and silver
islands; though, by reason of several unfortunate accidents, they
both returned re infect&agrave;." Short mention is afterwards made of
Captain Kwast's journal, together with the writings of the merchants who
were with him, as fallows: "That in the South Sea, at the 37-1/2 degrees
Northern latitude, and about 400 Spanish, or 343 Dutch miles,
that is, 28 degrees longitude East of Japan, there lay a very great
and high island, inhabited by a white, handsome, kind and civilized
people, exceedingly opulent in gold and silver, &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>

<p>From these extracts it appears, that, in the short account of the
journals of the two Dutch vessels, no longitude is mentioned to the
East of Nova Zemla; but the discoveries of Kwast were made in the South
sea, to which place he, as well as Captain Vries afterwards, must have
sailed round the Cape of Good Hope. The author of the narrative
concludes, indeed, that the N. E. passage is practicable, in the
following words: "to promote this passage out of the East-Indies to the
North into Europe, it were necessary to sail from the East-Indies to
the Westward of Japan, all along Corea, to see how the sea-coasts
trend to the North of the said Corea, and with what conveniency
ships might sail as far as Nova Zemla, and to the North of the same.
Where our author saith, that undoubtedly it would be found, that
having passed the North corner of Nova Zemla, or, through Weygatz,
the North end of Yelmer land, one might go on South-Eastward,
and make a successful voyage." But mere conjectures cannot
be admitted as evidence. As we can find no other information relative
to the fact mentioned by Captain Wood and Mr. Engel, (namely, that
two Dutch vessels have passed 300 leagues to the East of Nova Zemla)
that we have no reason to credit mere assertions without proof: we
may therefore advance as a fact, that hitherto we have no authentic
account, that any vessel has ever passed the cape to the East of Nova
Zemla, which lies North of the river Piasida. See Relation of Wood's
Voyage, &amp;c. in the Account of several late Voyages and Discoveries
to the South and North, &amp;c. London, 1694, p. 148. See also Engel,
Mem. et Obs. Geog. p. 231 to 234.</p>

href="#FNanchor_171_171"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> In order
thoroughly to understand this narrative, it is necessary to
inform the reader, that the voyage made by Deshneff was entirely
forgotten, until the year 1736, when Mr. Muller found, in the archives
of Yakutsk, the original accounts of the Russian navigations in the
Frozen Ocean.</p>

<p>These papers were extracted, under his inspection, at Yakutsk, and
sent to Petersburg; where they are now preserved in the library
belonging to the Imperial Academy of Sciences: they consist of several
folio volumes. The circumstances relating to Deshneff are contained in
the second volume. Soliverstoff and Stadukin, having laid claim to the
discovery of the country on the mouth of the Anadyr, had asserted, in
consequence of this claim, that they had arrived there by sea, after
having doubled Tschukotskoi Noss. Deshneff, in answer, sent several
memorials, petitions, and complaints, against Stadukin and Soliverstoff,
to the commander of Yakutsk, in which he sets forth, that he had
the sole right to that discovery, and refutes the arguments advanced by
the others. From these memorials Mr. Muller has extracted his account
of Deshneff's voyage. When I was at Petersburg I had an opportunity
of seeing these papers: and as they are written in the Russian language,
I prevailed upon my ingenious friend Mr. Pallas to inspect the part
which relates to Deshneff. Accordingly Mr. Pallas, with his usual
readiness to oblige, not only compared the memorials with Mr. Muller's
account, but even took the trouble to make some extracts in the most
material passages: these extracts are here subjoined; because they will
not only serve to confirm the exactness of Mr. Muller; but also because
they tend to throw some light on several obscure passages. In one of
Deshneff's memorials he says, "To go from the river Kovyma to the
Anadyr, a great promontory must be doubled, which stretches very far
into the sea: it is not that promontory which lies next to the river
Tschukotskia. Stadukin never arrived at this great promontory:
near it are two islands, whose inhabitants make holes in their
under-lips, and insert therein pieces of the sea-horse tush, worked
into the form of teeth. This promontory stretches between North and
North East: It is known on the Russian side by the little river
Stanovie, which flows into the sea, near the spot where the Tschutski
have erected a heap of whale-bones like a tower. The coast from the
promontory turns round towards the Anadyr, and it is possible to sail
with a good wind from the point to that river in three days and nights,
and no more: and it will take up no more time to go by land to the same
river, because it discharges itself into a bay." In another memorial
Deshneff says, "that he was ordered to go by sea from the Indigirka
to the Kovyma; and from thence with his crew to the Anadyr, which
was then newly discovered. That the first time he sailed from the
Kovyma, he was forced by the ice to return to that river; but that
next year he again sailed from thence by sea, and after great danger,
misfortunes, and with the loss of part of his shipping, arrived at last
at the mouth of the Anadyr. Stadukin having in vain attempted to
go by sea, afterwards ventured to pass over the chain of mountains
then unknown; and reached by that means the Anadyr. Soliverstoff
and his party, who quarrelled with Deshneff, went to the same
place from the Kovyma by land; and the tribute was afterwards sent
to the last mentioned river across the mountains, which were very
dangerous to pass amidst the tribes of Koriacs and Yukagirs, who had
been lately reduced by the Russians."</p>

<p>In another memorial Deshneff complains bitterly of Soliverstoff;
and asserts, "that one Severka Martemyanoff, who had been gained
over by Soliverstoff, was sent to Yakutsk, with an account that he
(Soliverstoff) had discovered the coasts to the North of the Anadyr,
where large numbers of sea-horses are found." Deshneff hereupon says,
that Soliverstoff and Stadukin never reached the rocky promontory,
which is inhabited by numerous bodies of the Tichutski; over against
which are islands whose inhabitants wear artificial teeth thrust through
their under lips. This is not the first promontory from the river Kovyma,
called Svatoi Noss; but another far more considerable, and
very-well known to him (Deshneff), because the vessel of Ankunidoff
was wrecked there; and because he had there taken prisoners some of
the people, who were rowing in their boats; and seen the islanders
with teeth in their lips. He also well knew, that it was still far from
that promontory to the river Anadyr."</p></div>

href="#FNanchor_172_172"><span class="label">[172]</span></a> That is,
by sea, from the mouth of the Anadyr, round Tschukotskoi
Noss to the river Lena, and then up that river to Yakutsk.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_173_173" id="Footnote_173_173"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_173_173"><span class="label">[173]</span></a> We may
collect from Deshneff's reasoning, that Soliverstoff, in endeavouring
to prove that he had sailed round the Eastern extremity of
Asia, had mistaken a promontory called Svatoi Noss for Tschukotskoi
Noss: for otherwise, why should Deshneff, in his refutation of
Soliverstoff, begin by asserting, that Svatoi Noss was not Tschukotskoi
Noss? The only cape laid down in the Russian maps, under the name of
Svatoi Noss, is situated 25 degrees to the West of the Kovyma: but we
cannot possibly suppose this to be the promontory here alluded to;
because, in sailing from the Kovyma towards the Anadyr, "the first
promontory which presents itself" must necessarily be East of the
Kovyma. Svatoi Noss, in the Russian language, signifies Sacred
Promontory; and the Russians occasionally apply it to any cape which it
is difficult to double. It therefore most probably here relates to the
first cape, which Soliverstoff reached after he had sailed from Kovyma.</p></div>

Mr. Engel indeed pretends that lieutenant Laptieff, in 1739, doubled
Tschukotskoi-Noss, because Gmelin says, that "he passed from the
Kovyma to Anadirsk partly by water and partly by land." For Mr.
Engel asserts the impossibility of getting from the Kovyma to Anadirsk,
partly by land and partly by water, without going from the Kovyma to
the mouth of the Anadyr by sea; and from thence to Anadirsk by land.
But Mr. Muller (who has given a more particular account of the
conclusion of this expedition) informs us, that Laptieff and his crew,
after having wintered near the Indigirka, passed from its mouth in small
boats to the Kovyma; and as it was dangerous, on account of the
Tschutski, to follow the coast any farther, either by land or water, he
went through the interior part of the country to Anadirsk, and from thence to the mouth
of the Anadyr. Gmelin Reise, vol. II. p. 440. S. R. G. III. p. 157.</p>

<p>Mention is also made by Gmelin of a man who passed in a small
boat from the Kovyma round Tschukotskoi-Noss into the sea of Kamtchatka:
and Mr. Engel has not omitted to bring this passage in support
of his system, with this difference, that he refers to the authority of
Muller, instead of Gmelin, for the truth of the fact. But as we have
no account of this expedition, and as the manner in which it is
mentioned by Gmelin implies that he had it merely from tradition, we
cannot lay any stress upon such vague and uncertain reports. The passage is as follows:
"Es find so gar Spuren vorhanden, dass ein Kerl mit einem Schifflein,
das nicht viel groesser als ein Schifferkahn gevesen, von Kolyma bis
Tschukotskoi-Noss vorbey, und bis nach Kamtschatka gekommen sey."

in his voyage from Kamtchatka, in 1628, towards Tschukotskoi-Noss,
sailed along the coast of the Tschutski as high as lat.
67&deg; 18&acute;. and observing the coast take a Westerly direction,
he too hastily concluded, that he had passed the North Eastern
extremity. Apprehensive, if he had attempted to proceed, of being
locked in by the ice, he returned to Kamtchatka. If he had followed
the shore, he would have found, that what he took for the Northern
ocean was nothing more than a deep bay: and that the coast of the
Tschutski, which he considered as turning uniformly to the West, took
again a Northerly direction. S.R.G. III. p. 117.</p></div>

islands are Medviedkie Ostrova, or the Bear Islands; they
are also called Kreffstoffskie Ostrova, because they lie opposite the
mouth of the small river Krestova. For a long time vague reports were
propagated that the continent of America was stretched along the Frozen
Ocean, very near the coasts of Siberia; and some persons pretended to
have discovered its shore not far from the rivers Kovyma and Krestova.
But the falsity of these reports was proved by an expedition made in
1764, by some Russian officers sent by Denys Ivanovitch Tschitcherin,
governor of Tobolsk. These officers went in winter, when the sea was
frozen, in sledges drawn by dogs, from the mouth of the Krestova.
They found nothing but five small rocky islands, since called the Bear
Islands, which were quite uninhabited; but some traces were
found of former inhabitants, namely, the ruins of huts. They observed
also on one of the islands a kind of wooden stage built of drift-wood,
which seemed as if it had been intended for defence. As far as they
durst venture out over the Frozen Sea, no land could be seen, but
high mountains of ice obstructed their passage, and forced them to
return. See the map of this expedition upon the chart of Shalauroff's
voyage prefixed to this number.</p></div>
